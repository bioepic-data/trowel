This study focuses on understanding ecosystem metabolism for the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River in Washington state, a free-flowing stretch with a substantial discharge. Large rivers have been overlooked compared to small and medium rivers due to the challenges associated with measurements. Our study presents novel ways to address these challenges and highlights that metabolism patterns in large rivers differ from those observed in small-medium rivers and requires the application of knowledge and tools beyond those implemented for smaller rivers. This data package includes the data and R scripts for the analyses described in Roley et al. 2023. It includes dissolved oxygen and temperature data from a dissolved oxygen HOBO sensor, light data collected from the National Solar Radiation Database (https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/) and hydrologic variables estimated from the MASS-1 model (Niehus et al.; 2014). It also includes metabolism estimates (gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem production) estimated via streamMetabolizer (Appling et al.; 2018). All analyses in the paper can be replicated with these data and scripts. The data package is comprised of one main data folder. The folder includes (1) file-level metadata (flmd); (2) a data dictionary (dd) for each data file; (3) data files; and (4) R scripts for metabolism estimates and data analysis. All files are .R, .csv, or .pdf."	Columbia River, WA, USA	For a full description of the methods, see the methods section from Roley et al., 2023. Briefly, in this study we estimate reach-scale metabolism for the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River in Washington state. To do this, we deployed HOBO dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature loggers in the Columbia River and used those data to estimate whole-stream metabolism (photosynthesis and respiration). We also used data from publicly available sources (National Solar Radiation Database https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/ and Grant County Public Utilities District http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/). After estimating metabolism, we analyzed drivers of metabolism.

Please contact Brieanne Forbes (brieanne.forbes@pnnl.gov) for information on the timeline of upload. This dataset supports a broader study examining the drivers of spatial variability in sediment respiration rates in the Yakima River Basin. We acknowledge the Yakama Nation as owners and caretakers of the lands where we collected these data. We thank the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation Tribal Council and Yakama Nation Fisheries for working with us to facilitate sample collection and optimization of data usage according to their values and worldview. The dataset provides model results generated using streamMetabolizer (Appling et al.; 2018) using data collected during the same five-week period at 48 sites within multiple rivers throughout the Yakima River Basin in Washington, USA. The contents include model inputs and outputs for total ecosystem respiration; calculated sediment respiration; processing scripts; median grain size (d50); and annual oxygen consumption. Samples collected during this study were labeled as “Second Spatial Study” or “SSS.” Raw time series sensor data, total suspended solids, and depth data from SSS were published at https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/datasets/doi:10.15485/1969566. A subset of data from the SSS samples were published in the contiguous United States (CONUS)-Scale Model-Sample (CM) study data package available at https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/doi:10.15485/1923689 that presents data from across the CONUS. They include dissolved organic carbon (DOC, measured as non-purgeable organic carbon, NPOC), total nitrogen (TN), grain size, aerobic sediment respiration, dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature. Parent IDs and Site IDs are consistent between the SSS and CM data packages, and they can be mapped directly so data across packages can be used together. Field metadata for the samples in this data package can be found at either link. This dataset is comprised of one main data folder with three subfolders. The main data folder contains of (1) file-level metadata; (2) data dictionary; (3) total/water column/sediment respiration; (4) median grain size (d50); and (5) annual oxygen consumption. The subfolders contain (1) model input files; (2) model output files; and (3) processing scripts. All files are .csv, .pdf, .R, .Rmd, or .html. Site T42 was mislabeled as T41.

SSS001, S63, Satus Creek, Washington	In situ dissolved oxygen, temperature, and water pressure sensors were deployed at 48 sites by 2-person teams in multiple rivers within the Yakima River Basin during the week of July 25-28, 2022. Barometric pressure dataloggers were deployed at a subset of the sites at that time. Triplicate 2-hour dark-bottle stream water incubations were carried out and the datalogging sensors were checked and cleaned at the same 48 sites by 2-person teams during the week of August 8-12, 2022. At most sites, reach-average depth data was also collected during the week of August 8-12, 2022 by wading the stream, taking multiple manual measurements along multiple transects. When this wading depth method was not feasible, depth was measured via sonar from a kayak or jetboat, or calculated using public models or gauge data. In situ sensors from July deployments were retrieved by 2-person teams during the week of August 29-September 1, 2022. As a result, the logged deployments consist of approximately one month. The inverse model streamMetabolizer (Appling et al.; 2018) was used to estimate a deployment-period-average ecosystem respiration rate, gross primary production, and gas exchange velocity (K600) for each site. D50 was estimated as described in Gomez-Velez et al. (2015) and published in Gomez-Velez et al. (2023). Annual oxygen consumption was estimated using the methods described in Son et al. (2022).

This data package includes the key model inputs/outputs of the river corridor model for the Columbia River Basin (CRB) and the model source codes, which were used in the manuscript. The model is a carbon-nitrogen-coupled river corridor model (RCM), and the model is used to quantify hyporheic zone (HZ) aerobic and anaerobic respiration at the NHDPLUS stream reach scales. The RCM used in this study combines empirical substrate models derived from observations and three microbially driven reactions to compute respiration of the HZ for each National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) reach within the CRB. The reactions in HZs of each NHD reach include anaerobic respiration and two-step anaerobic respiration via denitrification. Our HZ respiration estimates are limited to the lotic (or flowing) stream/river systems, and do not account for the respiration process in water column. Note that the RCM only simulates the HZ’s contribution to the dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the streams, and the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere are not modelled. The model computes at hourly timesteps because of the fast reaction rates. The key input data of the model are exchange flux, residence time, and stream solute (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved oxygen (DO), and nitrate concentrations). These inputs are constant over time and represent long-term averaged values. This modeling framework successfully quantified HZ respiration components over multiple scales. It revealed key mechanisms driving the spatial variation of HZ aerobic and anaerobic respiration in reaches with varying hydrologic and substrate conditions. Thus, this modeling study offers a testing hypothesis in different river system (e.g., climate and biomes) for the HZ respiration processes, and can be used as a sampling design tool for large-scale HZ experimental studies. This dataset contains five folders: (1) model_inputs, (2) model_outputs, (3) Rscripts, (4) figures, and (5) model_codes. It also contains a readme, file level metadata (FLMD), and data dictionary (dd). Please see the FLMD for a list of all the files contained in this data package and descriptions for each.

We carried out many testing and calibration experiments on a system of small oxygen consumption batch reactors designed for use with water and sediment samples for environmental questions. The oxygen sensing system is based very directly on the work of Larsen, et al. [2011], and similar oxygen sensing technology is widely used in the literature. Our primary focus was on practical considerations, such as temperature effects, lighting angle effects, sterilization, and other similar situations that a user may find useful. Most of the tests required comparing “base” calibration curves to “treatment” calibration curves to determine the extent to which the treatment impacted the reported measurements. This data package contains the performance and calibration data collected for that purpose. This dataset is comprised of one data folder containing (1) file-level metadata; (2) data dictionary; (3) readme; (4) diffusion test result files; (5) limit of detection test result files; (6) temperature impact files; (7) a main data file that contains test results for all other tests; and (8) an R script that uses Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to determine whether treatment calibrations are significantly different from their respective base calibrations.

BR, Columbia River, Washington, United States	The grain size data are extracted for each photo using You Look Only Once (YOLO), a pre-trained object detection model. The trained YOLO model generated labels for each photo listed in the data package subfolders 1 to 4. A Matlab script was developed to convert these labels to grain size distribution data, calculate characteristic grain sizes (e.g., 5th, 50th, and 84th percentile of the grain size distributions), and derive hydro-biogeochemical parameters using these derived grain sizes and measured flow depth and velocity data. Details of the methods can be found in the associated paper.

A combination of soil pits, trenches, and cores were used to describe, sample, and map the cross-section stratigraphy of soil horizons and ice wedges for each polygon at 6 depth intervals. Observed soil horizons were assigned to four types with increasing amounts of organic components (mineral, mineral/organic, organic/mineral, and organic). The average ice contents of each soil horizon type below the permafrost boundary and wedge ice were weighted by their cross-sectional area fractions to calculate spatially averaged estimates of ice content for each polygon. In the active layer, spatially averaged estimates of volumetric water contents were similarly determined and reported here as “ice” content to enable estimates of the soil’s structurally competent porosity and excess ice in permafrost layers. In this dataset, the file AK13_ice_contents.csv includes cross-sectional area fractions and spatially averaged ice contents for soil layers and horizon types at the six depth intervals. The file AK13_permafrost_ice_fractions.csv contains the calculated partitioning of ice contents into pore ice and excess ice fractions for the three permafrost-dominated depth intervals. In addition, there is a data dictionary file for each of these data files and a file-level metadata file. These data were generated by the Department of Energy’s Soil Carbon Response to Environmental Change Scientific Focus Area and were used as inputs to model simulations examining the consequences of thaw-affected subsidence and microtopography change on active layer thickness of low-relief polygonal tundra landscapes in a warming Arctic.	Barrow Environmental Observatory and areas south of Gas Well Road, Utqiagvik, on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska	Sampling Design Three low-centered and three flat-centered ice wedge polygons (IWP) near Utqiaġvik, Alaska were selected for study. Two of each IWP type were within the Barrow Environmental Observatory and one of each type was located south of Gas Well Road. Transects across each IWP were established from trough center to trough center. A combination of soil pits, trenches and cores along the transects were used to describe, sample, and map the cross-section stratigraphy of soil horizons and ice wedges. Soil pits (about 2-m long by 1-1.5 m deep) were excavated with shovels and jackhammers and were typically placed from the edge of the trough over the rim towards the center of the polygon to capture soil cryoturbation associated with ice wedge growth over time. Soil cores were taken with a SIPRE corer from the bottom of excavated pits to depths of up to 3 m from the surface. Trenches were cut with spades to examine and sample the stratigraphy of thawed surface soils, and SIPRE cores were taken from the bottom of the trench to sample frozen soil at depths of up to 2.5 m. For individual cores, a small block of thawed surface soil was first cut and removed with a spade for sampling, followed by coring of the frozen soil beneath. A number of closely spaced individual cores were taken to determine the size and shape of ice wedges. The specific sampling design applied to each polygon varied depending on its size, hydrologic conditions, and the amount of spatial variation in stratigraphy observed during sampling. Sample Collection A total of over 350 samples were collected from the pits, trenches, and cores by using methods described in Ping et al. (2013, Sampling protocols for permafrost‐affected soils, Soil Horizons, 54:13-19). Briefly, the exposed faces of soil pits and trenches were photographed and examined to identify and describe soil horizons. The two-dimensional profile of horizon stratigraphy was drawn to scale (including ice wedges and other large ice pockets) and used to guide sample collection. The position of the permafrost table was estimated on the basis of observed cryostructures and recorded in the field drawings. Samples representing each soil horizon were taken with a hole saw connected to a battery powered hand drill or by cutting rectangular blocks with a knife. Soil cores were similarly examined to identify soil horizons and record their positions relative to the soil surface. Cores were then sectioned and sampled to represent each horizon. The dimensions of all samples were recorded to determine sample volume. Samples were sealed in plastic bags and tightly packed in coolers where the mass of frozen soil kept unfrozen samples cold and prevented frozen samples from thawing. All samples were stored at -20 deg Celsius at the end of each day, shipped overnight to Argonne National Laboratory, and maintained at that temperature until processed. Sample Processing and Analysis Initial sample (wet) weights were measured in the frozen state before processing. Most samples were thawed overnight and then dried at 60 deg Celsius, but some were lyophilized in a freeze dryer. After determining the dry weight of the entire sample, samples were passed through a 2-mm sieve to remove roots and infrequent small pebbles, and a representative subsample was dried at 105 deg Celsius to enable correction of total dry weights to oven-dry (105 deg Celsius) weights. The volumetric ice content (vol %) of all samples (including unfrozen active layer soils) was calculated as: (sample wet weight [g] – sample oven-dry weight [g]) / ice density (0.917 g cm^-3) / sample volume (cm^3) x 100 In addition to water/ice contents, sample bulk density (BD) was determined (oven-dry weight / sample volume), and samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) by dry combustion in an elemental analyzer. The data for all samples from a given soil horizon within each IWP were averaged to best represent the properties of that horizon. Spatially Averaged Estimates of Ice Content for IWP Cross-Sectional Profiles Field drawings and core logs of soil horizon stratigraphy, coupled with laboratory data (TOC, TN, BD, and ice contents), were interpreted to create to-scale digital images of the two-dimensional, cross-sectional soil profiles for each IWP, spanning from trough center to trough center to a depth of 3 meters. Digital image analysis was used to determine the spatial area of each soil horizon (expressed as unit fractions) within each IWP profile at 6 depth intervals (0-0.15 m, 0.15-0.3 m, 0.3-0.45 m, 0.45-1 m, 1-2 m, and 2-3 m). Each sampled horizon was then assigned to one of four horizon types with increasing amounts of organic components (mineral, mineral/organic, organic/mineral, and organic). For each depth interval within each IWP, the ice content (vol %) of a given horizon type was calculated as the spatial average of the constituent sampled-horizon ice contents of that type occurring within that depth interval: ((Ice%_H1 x Area_H1) + (Ice%_H2 x Area_H2) … + (Ice%_Hn x Area_Hn)) / (Area_H1 + Area_H2 … + Area_Hn); where H1, H2, … Hn refer to the sampled horizons assigned to a given horizon type, Ice% is the average vol% of all samples taken from a given sampled horizon, and Area is the unit fraction of the sampled horizon relative to the total cross-sectional area for a given depth interval within the IWP profile.

These data were generated to understand temporal and vegetation patterns associated with wetland carbon cycling. Specifically, this dataset intends to answer how carbon dioxide and methane fluxes change monthly and hourly across sites with vegetation and without vegetation. Data includes chamber measurements that were measured in both sites with vegetation and without vegetation and that were collected hourly, for 12 hours, and monthly, for four months. The file soilrespiration_data.csv contains these data, and the metadata file (soilrespiration_chammetadata.csv) and location metadata file (soilrespiration_locationmetadata.csv) have information on locations where the chambers were placed and sampled in the wetland. Data processing was done on raw methane fluxes (Flux_CH4) to remove the influence of ebullition (Flux_CH4_ebullition) to get a diffusive flux (Flux_CH4_diffusive).	Old Woman Creek (OWC) National Estuarine Research Reserve, Huron, OH (Ameriflux site: Old Woman Creek) is a freshwater marsh located to the south of Lake Erie. A sand beach barrier separates the marsh from the lake, but this barrier periodically erodes which hydrologically links the marsh to the lake until the barrier reforms. To the east of the main channel at OWC is a shallow side channel that flows west into the main channel, referred to as the cove. Sampling was performed at six locations in the cove (3 vegetated and 3 non vegetated locations) using floating chambers.	Six sites were chosen in the cove that contained either vegetation or no vegetation with boardwalk access so the soils would not be disturbed when sampling. A portable gas analyzer (Gas Scouter G4301, Picarro Inc., Santa Clara, CA) was used to measure carbon fluxes at the six sites, and the gas analyzer was connected to a clear, half dome chamber that floats on the water surface via bev-a-line tubing. The closed loop design routes the gas from the chamber to the laser. A small fan was positioned in the chamber to circulate the gas to avoid stratification. An infrared digital thermometer was used to measure chamber temperature at the start and end of each two minute measurement period. The barometric pressure was recorded using a watch (Casio SGW-300H). Gas fluxes were measured for two minutes, and the two-minute interval began after the chamber was placed on the water surface and carbon concentrations stabilized. Data were collected hourly from 7 AM to 7 PM and monthly from July to October 2022. We processed the flux chamber measurements by calculating the accumulation or removal rate of CO2 or CH4 in the headspace of the chamber over each individual measurement period. To account for the effect of bubbles in each measurement period we used the approach developed by Villa et al. In brief, all two-minute CH4 concentration measurements were plotted using MATLAB R2020b (MathWorks, Natick, MA) and visually assessed. Measurements qualitatively determined to lack ebullition (i.e., no sudden jumps in concentration between two subsequent points) were used to calculate a bubble threshold (i.e., the maximum difference in CH4 concentration between two points in the absence of bubbles). Any instantaneous increase in CH4 between two 1 Hz measurement points above this threshold in other chambers was considered a bubble, and the concentration increase due to this bubble was subtracted from the concentration-time series following the bubble occurrence time. We fitted the concentration time series without the bubbles to the Hutchinson-Mosier one-dimensional exponential decay fit model to determine the diffusive fluxes for each site. The contribution of ebullition was calculated by adding all the above-threshold concentration jumps during the 2-minute observation period and was added to the diffusive flux. Hutchinson, G. L. & Mosier, A. R. Improved soil cover method for field measurement of nitrous oxide fluxes. Soil Science Society of America Journal 45, 311–316 (1981). Final fluxes for CO2 and CH4 were averaged hourly across the three replicates in vegetated and non-vegetated sites to establish estimates for fluxes at a point in time. All flux calculations were performed using MATLAB R2020b (MathWorks, Natick, MA) using code provided by Villa et al. Villa, J. A. et al.

The distribution of sediment grain size in streams and rivers is often quantified by the median grain size (d50), a key metric for understanding and predicting hydrologic and biogeochemical function of streams and rivers. Manual methods to measure d50 are time-consuming and ignore larger grains, while model-based methods to estimate d50 often over-generalize basin characteristics, and therefore cannot accurately represent site-scale heterogeneity. Here, we apply a machine learning-enabled photogrammetry methodology (You Only Look Once, or YOLO) for estimating d50 for grains > 2 mm based on images collected from streams and rivers throughout the Yakima River Basin (YRB). To understand how such methods may help bridge the gaps in resolution and accuracy between manual and catchment characteristics model-based d50 estimates, we compared YOLO d50 values to manual and model-based estimates across the YRB. We found distinct differences among methods for d50 averages and variability, and relationships between d50 estimates and basin characteristics.

S13R, Cle Elum River, Washington, United States	Images of riverbed grains were collected during a 2021 field campaign (171 images across 40 sites in the Yakima River basin, or YRB). A model using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm was trained to identify and measure individual grains, which was used to calculate the median grain size (d50) for each image. These values were compared to other d50 data sources in the YRB, including USGS manual measurements, and two continental-scale modeling approaches. We used simple spatial statistics and watershed characteristics to understand the similarities and differences between these d50 data sources and explore if the YOLO approach can help integrate between sparse, accurate manual measurements, and spatially resolved, generalized model estimates.

S19S_0006, Dead Run, Baltimore, Maryland, USA	We used ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry to characterize water extracted dissolved organic matter chemistry from surface sediments across the continental United States (CONUS). Dissolved organic matter chemistry was characterized by ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry. X-ray diffraction fluorescence (XRF) was used to characterize the sediment elemental composition. In addition, we obtained soil elemental composition from the National Geochemical Survey (NGS) provided by the United States Geological Survey (Grossman et al., 2004). Point samples from the NGS database were processed in ArcGIS and interpolated across the CONUS at 500 m resolution using an ordinary Kriging technique. Watershed scale soil elemental composition was then extrapolated using the “Geospatial Data Puller for Waters in the Contiguous United States” (Willi & Ross, 2023). Finally, land cover at the watershed scale for each sampling location was obtained from Garayburu-Caruso et al., 2022. This data had been previously obtained from the National Land Cover Database (Dewitz, 2020) and extrapolated using the “Geospatial Data Puller for Waters of the Contiguous United States” (Willi & Ross, 2023).

In this manuscript, organic matter chemistry and thermodynamics are directly connected to reactive transport simulators through the newly developed Lambda-PFLOTRAN (Parallel Reactive Flow and Transport model) workflow tool that succinctly incorporates organic matter chemistry data generated from Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) into reaction networks to simulate aerobic respiration of the organic matter and the resulting biogeochemistry. Lambda-PFLOTRAN is a python-based workflow, executed through a Jupyter Notebook interface, that digests raw FTICR-MS data, develops a representative reaction network based on substrate-explicit thermodynamic modeling (also termed lambda modeling due to its key thermodynamic parameter λ used therein), and completes a biogeochemical simulation with the open source, reactive flow, and transport code PFLOTRAN. This data package contains Jupyter Notebook based workflows for two test cases for running biogeochemical simulations of organic matter oxidation identified by FTICR-MS. It contains four primary folders (workflow, data, src, and analysis), a file-level metadata file (Muller_2024_Lambda_PFLOTRAN_Manuscript_Data_Package_flmd.csv) that lists all the files contained in this data package with a short description of each, and a data dictionary (Muller_2024_Lambda_PFLOTRAN_Manuscript_Data_Package_dd.csv) file that describes the tabular column headers. The ‘workflow’ folder contains the Jupyter Notebook based workflows for running the lambda analysis, PFLOTRAN simulation, sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation. The ‘data’ folder contains the FTICR-MS data, initial conditions, and incubation data for test cases 1 and 2 in folders titled ‘WHONDRS’ and ‘Colloids’, respectively. The data folder also has a ‘Database’ folder containing a reaction network for bulk organic matter (assumed to be CH2O) and a general database for PFLOTRAN (hanford_rxn_network). The CH2O reaction network defines bulk organic matter oxidation. Biogeochemical simulations are completed for both the lambda binned organic matter and bulk organic matter reaction networks. The ‘hanford_rxn_network’ database includes information required for PFLTORAN simulations including ion size, molar mass, and charge of the aqueous species, gases, and minerals phases. The ‘src’ folder contains python source codes for performing lambda analysis, PFLOTRAN simulation, sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation. The ‘analysis’ folder contains outputs from the test cases 1 and 2 including lambda analysis, PFLOTRAN runs and the calibration results.	Yakima River, Benton City, Washington, USA	This data package includes biogeochemical simulations using a Jupyter Notebook based workflow utilizing python scripts provided in the ‘src’ folder and FTICR-MS data provided in the data folder. The data folder also contains incubation data, either in the form of oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide generation, and initial aqueous chemistry conditions for two test cases. The experimental data were collected from Goldman et al. (2020) and Ward et al. (2023) for test cases 1 and 2, respectively. The notebook digests the FTICR-MS data, develops a representative reaction network for aerobic respiration, and completes a biogeochemical simulation using a PFLOTRAN reaction sandbox specifically developed for incorporating organic matter chemistry informed by FTICR-MS (i.e., “reaction_sandbox_pnnl_lambda”). The lambda analysis, the best fit parameters (determined by ESMDA (Ensemble Smoother for Multiple Data Assimilation)) and the PFLOTRAN simulation results are provided in the analysis folder. The workflow also plots the results through post processing.

This study uses meta-analytical techniques to evaluate the effect of wildfire on in-stream responses in burned and unburned watersheds. The study aims to provide additional insight into the range of responses and net influences that wildfires have on hydro-biogeochemistry across broad spatial scales, burn extents, and the persistence of water-quality change. This study compiles data and metadata from 18 total publications that includes 1) surface water geochemistry data (dissolved organic carbon; nitrate), 2) climate classifications, 3) year of the wildfire, 4) the time lag between when the fire occurred and when the sampling occurred, and 5) study design of the publication. In total, this meta-analysis draws data that spans 8 climate guilds, 3 biomes, 62 watersheds, and 20 unique wildfires. See Sites_meta_data.csv for citations of the papers used in this meta-analysis.

(2021), Anaktuvuk River Fire, Alaska, United States	We performed a systematic literature search in September 2023 on Scopus and Web of Science to generate a list of peer-reviewed publications reporting the effects of fire on dissolved organic carbon and nitrate in burned versus unburned watersheds. The following keywords were used: “wildfire” OR “fire” AND “dissolved organic carbon” OR “nitrate” AND “concentration” AND “export” OR “discharge” OR “stream” OR “river” OR “creek” OR “watershed”. From the initial list of publications, we only retained studies matching all five of the following criteria: (1) the burn was a wildfire; (2) paired watershed study design encompassed both burned and unburned reference sites; (3) data included either DOC or nitrate; 4) data were reported as time-series allowing us to interpret seasonal variability in concentrations, and 5) located within North America. To prepare the data for meta-analysis, we created a summary file (“effect_size_geospatial_fire_lat_long.csv”) that consists of site level metadata, climate characteristics, and the effect size calculated for each site included in the study. Due to the lack of accessible data across publications, we generated a pseudo yield metric to facilitate intercomparisons across watersheds of different sizes. To analyze the proportional difference between burned and unburned in-stream solute concentrations, we calculated the effect size statistical metric. Effect sizes were converted to percent differences. Mixed-effects models were used to determine the significance of climate, time-since-fire, and burn extent response to fire.

This work was led by the environmental geophysics team from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as part of the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments: Arctic (NGEE Arctic). The multiple photogrammetric surveys used mostly a DJI Matrice 210 UAS with a DJI X5S camera, Ground Control Points (GCPs) surveyed with a Real Time Kinematic (RTK)-GPS, and a structure from motion (SfM) technique for photogrammetric reconstruction. Digital Surface elevation Models (DSMs) were inferred at various times of year, including near peak in plant and leaf density (July 19 2017), close to peak in snow depth (April 1 2019 and April 11 2022), and at low plant and leaf density of tall after the first bare-ground date (June 9 2019). Snow and canopy height were obtained by subtracting DSMs from a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) proxy inferred from the June 9 2019 survey. The derived products include ortho-mosaiced RGB map, DSMs, a DTM proxy, snow depth (April 2019 and 2022) and canopy height (July 2017). Unprocessed and processed data products are included in this package (processing levels 0-2). Data and metadata are provided as text (*.csv), image (*.jpg), and GeoTiff (*.tif) formats. This metadata document contains a description of the survey and processing steps and the inferred products. The Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments: Arctic (NGEE Arctic) was a 15-year research effort (2012-2027) to reduce uncertainty in Earth System Models by developing a predictive understanding of carbon-rich Arctic ecosystems and feedbacks to climate. NGEE Arctic was supported by the Department of Energy’s Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska. Through observations, experiments, and synthesis with existing datasets, NGEE Arctic provided an enhanced knowledge base for multi-scale modeling and contributed to improved process representation at global pan-Arctic scales within the Department of Energy’s Earth system Model (the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, or E3SM), and specifically within the E3SM Land Model component (ELM).	The surveyed area is associated with a watershed near Teller road mile marker 27, Seward Peninsula, Alaska	Data acquisition, processing and accuracy Surface elevation models were inferred at various times of year, including near peak in plant and leaf density (July 19 2017), close to peak in snow depth (April 1 2019 and April 11 2022), and at low plant and leaf density after the first bare-ground date (June 9 2019). The surveys covered ~1.7 km2 out of the 2.2 km2 watershed with missing areas located along the edges of the watershed. Each survey consisted in 7-10 UAS flights at an elevation between 70 and 100 m above ground surface, providing imagery with a ground resolution in the order of 2 to 5 cm. The GCPs involved approximately 50 targets deployed at each acquisition time, surveyed with a Real Time Kinematic (RTK)-GPS, and used with the UAV-based imagery to generate surface elevation models with 10 cm grid cell size. The photogrammetric reconstructions have been done using a structure-from-motion-based reconstruction software (Agisoft Metashape). The processing has been done following Agisoft Metashape guidelines, and the workflow documentation provided in Over et al., 2021. One step that has been crucial to ensure accurate results is that after an initial “alignment” of the pictures using their low-accuracy coordinates from the UAS-camera and picking the high-accuracy GCPs, the “alignment” was performed again after unchecking the “source” option (i.e. not considering the UAV picture coordinates anymore) and using only the RTK-surveyed GCPs. It enabled better results than keeping the UAV-camera coordinates, even if those were assigned a high uncertainty. The surveyed area and the number of GCPs is variable. In general, GCPs have been distributed across the surveyed domain in a relatively similar pattern for each survey, though the winter surveys cover a smaller area than the snow-free surveys. The file named GCP_coverage.pdf shows how the GCP are distributed for each acquisition date, as well as the area used for analysis in Shirley et al. (2024). The domain outside the Shirley et al. (2024) studied area (named “big area” in the pdf document) is expected to be more prone to error as it gets closer to the perimeter of the GCP locations and surveyed area. Snow and canopy height were obtained by subtracting DSMs from a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) proxy. The DTM proxy was generated from the June 9 2019 DSM by keeping and interpolating only the grid cells with values that were less than 0.5 m higher than the minimum value in a centered 5 m side window. This approach aimed at removing grid cells that were linked to the presence of willow branches and/or early leaves, with the caveat of slightly smoothing the elevation change at geomorphological features boundaries. Vegetation height and snow depth products were obtained by subtracting the terrain elevation proxy from the other surface elevation models. The comparison of the generated products with RTK-GPS measurement along several transects is discussed in Shirley et al. (2024). In particular, UAV derived products were compared with ground measurements of surface elevation, snow depth, and vegetation height collected using RTK-GPS and snow probe measurements along several transects in the watershed. Please note that snow probe measurements have limited reliability due to either over-probing (into the litter layer or even the soil if it is soft) or under-probing (due to frozen moss or surface ice). Additionally, vegetation height measurements performed with a probe are subject to interpretation of the location of the top of the canopy that may differ significantly from person to person and from the structure-from-motion reconstruction. In spite of these strong limitations, we found strong agreement between the UAV derived products and the ground measurements. The RMSE of the UAV derived ground surface elevation compared to the RTK-GPS measurements is 17 cm, the RMSE of the UAV derived snow surface elevation compared to RTK-GPS plus snow probe measurements is 18 cm for the April 2019 dataset, and the RMSE of the UAV derived snow depths compared to the snow probe measurements is 16 cm for the April 2019 dataset. The snow surface elevation inaccuracy is higher in April 2022 than in April 2019 (based on Agisoft: xy and z error equal to 5.25 and 1.06 cm in April 2019, vs 119.82 and 12.81 cm in April 2022). In April 2022, the RTK-GPS base station tripod did sink/tilt in the snow over a few days, and the base station OPUS corrected coordinates was not obtained for each single day (due to data saving issues on the base station). It involved some inaccuracy in the survey of the GCPs coordinates, that resulted in inaccuracies in the snow surface elevation product. Still, this inaccuracy is believed to be of limited impact on the snow depth estimation because of the smoothed changes in elevation across the domain present in winter. Additional comparison between the snow thickness inferred in April 2022 and other independent datasets (LiDAR and DTP data) will be presented in Chen et al. (in prep). We consider the overall quality of the entire dataset to be high, although we expect that the largest errors are located along the edge of terraces, which are smoothed in the terrain proxy, and at a few locations in dense willow patches where the DTM proxy remains too high. While discrepancies exist between the UAV and GPS products regarding plant height, in general the mean shrub height in each patch is similar for both the UAV product and the ground measurements. Also, we expect that the vegetation height product is primarily associated with tall shrubs while dwarf shrub height (0 to 20 cm high) cannot be precisely estimated due to the limitation in estimating ground surface elevation in this vegetation type. Finally, it is to note that although the above approach used to infer a DTM proxy (and associated snow depth and vegetation height) has been quite effective at this site, its transferability to other sites is strongly dependent on canopy structure at the time of acquisition. The final coordinate system that is used for the various products is NAD83(2011) UTM N3, and NAVD88 Geoid12A for vertical information. And this coordinate system is also used as the reference for the GCP surveys. Note that the reconstructions in Agisoft were performed using GCPs in lat/lon coordinate system and with ellipsoid height (which implied a ~5.97 m upward shift (NAVD88 to WGS transform)), and then exported using NAD83 UTM Zone 3N with ellipsoid height. We then converted the elevation to NAVD88 Geoid12A (negative shift of ~ 5.97 m). Exception was for the 2022April dataset that was processed with elevation in NAD83(2011) ellipsoid height which implied a 5.26 m offset (back and forth). See csv files with GCP coordinates for more information. Data product types and processing levels All the dataset, with the exception of July 17 2017, have been acquired with a DJI Matrice 210. The survey on July 17 2017 was acquired using an DJI Inspire 1. Although unique values for flight height and forward and side overlap are provided below, those vary during each acquisition. The slope angle in the watershed varies between 0 and 10o, and each flight in the watershed involves moving upslope past the last acquired flight line and using that location as the next take-off location. The UAS is set to fly at a constant height above the take-off locations and thus the distance to the terrain varies during the acquisition, as well as the picture overlaps. The Agisoft Metashape reports provide some indications of the variability in picture coverage. Details on the acquisition, processing steps and products are provided in the archived files based on the guidelines provided by the ESS-DIVE Unoccupied Aerial System (UAS) data and metadata reporting format (Reporting format development v3.1.0, 26 September 2023).

These locations represent important and/or unique end-member locations for which solute concentrations can be diagnostic of the connection between terrestrial and aquatic systems. Such locations include drainages underlined entirely or largely by shale bedrock, land covered dominated by conifers, aspens, or meadows, and drainages impacted by historic mining activity and the presence of naturally mineralized rock. Developing a long-term record of solute concentrations from a diversity of environments is a critical component of quantifying the impacts of both climate change and discrete climate perturbations, such as drought, forest mortality, and wildfire, on the riverine export of multiple anionic species. Such data may be combined with stream gauging stations co-located at each monitoring site to directly quantify the seasonal and annual mass flux of these anionic species out of the watershed. This data package contains (1) a zip file (anion_data_2014-2024.zip) containing a total of 381 files: 380 data files of anion data from across the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area (SFA) which is reported in .csv files per location and a locations.csv (1 file) with latitude and longitude for each location; (2) a file-level metadata (v6_20250515_flmd.csv) file that lists each file contained in the dataset with associated metadata; and (3) a data dictionary (v6_20250515_dd.csv) file that contains terms/column_headers used throughout the files along with a definition, units, and data type.

The East River (ER) is a snow‐dominated, headwater basin of the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) located in the western United States. The ER is the designated testbed of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area (WFSFA). Through WFSFA, observational networks have been established to measure stream discharge and precipitation chemistry. The ER is considered representative of many snow‐dominated headwaters of the Rocky Mountains. The study domain encompasses nearly 85 square km, a 1.4‐km vertical drop in elevation (4,120 to 2,760 m) and pristine alpine, subalpine, montane, and riparian ecosystems. The ER contains high‐energy mountain streams to low‐energy meandering floodplains and is eroding primarily into the Cretaceous, carbon‐rich, marine shale of the Mancos Formation. Additional metadata on specific locations within the watershed are provided in the following related data package: Varadharajan C. et al. (2022) doi:10.15485/1660962	1. Samples are collected from (a) an automated sampler bottle in the case the Pumphouse-ISCO and Coal 11-ISCO surface water locations or (b) directly from the source for the tributary streams and groundwater monitoring wells (following pumping). Samples are filtered through 0.45-micrometer syringe filters into sealed vials and refrigerated until analysis. 2. Sample aliquots (500-microL) are added to auto-sampler vials fitted with filter caps and loaded onto a Dionex AS-40 autosampler prior to analysis using a Dionex ICS-2100 anion chromatograph equipped with AS11 and AG11 analytical and guard columns, respectively. Elution of the sample occurs at a flow rate of 1-mL/min in an eluent solution of 30-mM KOH with background conductivity suppression using a current of 80-mA. Eluted peaks are generated over an 18-minute run time, with peak assignments and concentrations determined through the use of known standards using the Dionex seven anion standard solution (fluoride, chloride, nitrite, sulfate, bromide, nitrate, and phosphate). Minimum peak resolutions correspond to a lower concentration limit of 0.1-microM for all analyzed species.

The East River is part of the Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area (WFSFA) located in the Upper Colorado River Basin, United States. TDN was analyzed using a Shimadzu Total Nitrogen Module (TNM-1) combined with the TOC-VCSH analyzer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). TNM-1 is a non-specific measurement of total nitrogen (TN). All nitrogen species in samples are combusted to nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, then reacted with ozone to form an excited state of nitrogen dioxide. Upon returning to ground state, light energy is emitted. Then, TDN is measured using a chemiluminescence detector. Ammonia was determined using a Lachat's QuikChem 8500 Series 2 Flow Injection Analysis System (LACHAT Instruments, QuckChem 8500 series 2, Automated Ion Analyzer, Loveland, Colorado). When ammonia in water samples is heated (60 degrees C) with salicylate and hypochlorite in an alkaline phosphate buffer, an emerald green color is produced which is proportional to the ammonia concentration. The color is intensified by the addition of nitroprusside. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is added to the buffer to prevent the interference of metal ions (Ca, Mg, and Fe etc.). Ammonia-N is then determined by LACHAT flow injection and a colorimetric assay at an absorbance wavelength 660 nm.

The QC check standards are repeated every 10 to 20 samples to monitor the instrument performance and potential drift. The QC check standard solutions are prepared with the IV-stock-1643 from vendor Inorganic Ventures (which is comparable to the NIST SRM 1643), and the LBNL-1A/1B customer specified standards from vendor Inorganic Ventures. Typically dilute 10-100x to get within concentration ranges of samples. - Internal standards are used for adjusting the potential drift of the instrument. 3. Data Processing and Report: - If find a problem with the calibrations (i.e., non-linear calibration) and the results from blank and QC check standards, then need to do troubleshooting and conduct the QA/QC processes again until the QA/QC results are satisfied. - Review sample data results: if find unusual sample data points and potential contaminations, re-run or report the problems and make notes in data reports. - Carefully convert the .csv files originally generated from instrument software to a more useable format (i.e. Excel files) and correct the dilution factors to generate final data reports. Report the data results with standard deviation (stdev). - Send the reports to SFA Watershed Function Data Management for further review and input to ESS-DIVE.

These locations represent important and/or unique end-member locations for which stable isotope values can be diagnostic of the connection between precipitation inputs as snow and rain and riverine export. Such locations include drainages underline entirely or largely by shale bedrock, land covered dominated by conifers, aspens, or meadows, and drainages impacted by historic mining activity and the presence of naturally mineralized rock. Developing a long-term record of water isotope values from a diversity of environments is a critical component of quantifying the impacts of both climate change and discrete climate perturbations, such as drought, forest mortality, and wildfire, on water export. Such data may be combined with stream gaging stations co-located at each surface water monitoring site to relate seasonal variations in water export to their stable isotopic signature.

The East River (ER) is a snow‐dominated, headwater basin of the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) located in the western United States. The ER is the designated testbed of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area (WFSFA). Through WFSFA, observational networks have been established to measure stream discharge and precipitation chemistry. The ER is considered representative of many snow‐dominated headwaters of the Rocky Mountains. The study domain encompasses nearly 85 square km, a 1.4‐km vertical drop in elevation (4,120 to 2,760 m) and pristine alpine, subalpine, montane, and riparian ecosystems. The ER contains high‐energy mountain streams to low‐energy meandering floodplains and is eroding primarily into the Cretaceous, carbon‐rich, marine shale of the Mancos Formation. Additional metadata on specific locations within the watershed are provided in the following related data package: Varadharajan C. et al. (2022) doi:10.15485/1660962	1. Samples are collected from (a) automated sampler bottles pre-filled with mineral oil to prevent evaporation upon sampling at the Pumphouse-ISCO and Coal 11-ISCO surface water locations or (b) directly from the source for the tributary streams and groundwater monitoring wells (following pumping). Precipitation samples were collected at 54 Paradise Road, Mt. Crested Butte, CO, 81225 on an event basis (snow or rain, depending upon season) over the 7-31-2014 to 10-14-2016 period. All samples are filtered through 0.45-µm syringe filters into sealed vials and refrigerated until analysis. 2. Sample aliquots (1500-microL) are added to auto-sampler vials fitted with septa-sealed caps and loaded onto an autosampler prior to analysis using either a Picarro L2130-i or Los Gatos Research Liquid Water Isotope Analyzer (LWIA) both of which operate using the same principle of laser absorbance spectroscopy using a cavity ringdown detector. Both instruments provide a precision of 0.025 and 0.1% for delta18O and delta2H, respectively.

Data were collected between October 1, 2022 to September 18, 2023 using iButton Link DS1921G-F5# Thermochron miniature temperature sensors (https://www.ibuttonlink.com/products/ds1921g) and Tinytag TGP-4017 internal sensors (https://www.micronmeters.com/product/tgp-4017-internal-sensor-40-to-85-c-40-f-to-185-f) deployed across the Kougarok and Teller sites. These sensors are a cost-efficient way to collect snowpack temperatures at a higher spatial resolution than what is normally achieved. iButton data were collected every 4 hours, while Tinytag data were collected every 30 minutes. In total, data were collected from 196 iButtons and 26 Tinytags. This dataset contains four *.csv files of near-ground surface temperatures at various locations throughout each study site and two *.kml files of sensor locations. Data were collected throughout the snow cover season so that snowpack characteristics could be derived using the temperature data. Sensors were placed both inside and outside of vegetation to better capture the spatial variability of snow properties across each domain. The Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments: Arctic (NGEE Arctic) was a 15-year research effort (2012-2027) to reduce uncertainty in Earth System Models by developing a predictive understanding of carbon-rich Arctic ecosystems and feedbacks to climate. NGEE Arctic was supported by the Department of Energy’s Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska. Through observations, experiments, and synthesis with existing datasets, NGEE Arctic provided an enhanced knowledge base for multi-scale modeling and contributed to improved process representation at global pan-Arctic scales within the Department of Energy’s Earth system Model (the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, or E3SM), and specifically within the E3SM Land Model component (ELM).	Teller Mile Marker 27 Field Site, Seward Peninsula, AK	Temperature sensors were placed in clusters throughout each study site. Locations were selected based on vegetation and topographical characteristics to collect measurements of snowpack temperatures under varying conditions. Ground surface temperature data were collected using DS1921G Thermochron iButtons and Tinytag TGP-4017 internal sensors, both of which are low cost, miniature temperature sensors suited for moderately long logging rates. The iButtons (figure 1) have a temperature range of -40°C to +85°C with an accuracy of ±1°C in the range of -30°C to +70°C and a thermal resolution of 0.5°C. Prior to deployment, iButton sensors were synced to Mountain Daylight Time (MDT) and programmed to record temperatures at 240 minute (4 hour) intervals starting on October 1, 2022. A maximum of 2048 temperatures can be logged and stored on each sensor. iButtons are not waterproof, so each sensor was vacuum sealed in a plastic bag to provide extra protection from moisture before being deployed in the field. Tinytags (Figure 2) are waterproof and have a temperature range of -40°C to +85°C. Throughout this temperature range, Tinytag measurement uncertainty stays below ±1°C. The Tinytag measurements are most accurate when temperatures are in the 20°C - 30°C range, at which point the measurement uncertainty falls just below ±0.5°C. These sensors have a thermal resolution of 0.01°C. Prior to deployment, Tinytag sensors were synced to Mountain Daylight Time (MDT) and programmed to record temperatures at 30 minute intervals. A maximum of 32,000 temperatures can be logged and stored on each sensor. iButtons and Tinytags were then placed throughout the watershed so that temperatures were collected across different ecosystem types.

Quantifying hydrologic exchange fluxes (HEFs) at the stream-groundwater interface, along with their residence time distributions (RTDs) in the subsurface, is crucial for managing water quality and ecosystem health in dynamic river corridors. However, directly simulating high-spatial resolution HEFs and RTDs can be a time-consuming process, particularly for watershed-scale modeling. Efficient surrogate models that link RTDs to hydromorphic units (HUs) may serve as alternatives for simulating RTDs in large-scale models. One common concern with these surrogate models, however, is the transferability of the relationship between the RTDs and HUs from one river corridor to another. To address this, we evaluated the HEFs and the resulting RTD-HU relationships for two 10-kilometer-long river corridors along the Columbia River, using a one-way coupled three-dimensional transient surface-subsurface water transport modeling framework that we previously developed. Applying this framework to the two river corridors with similar HUs allows for quantitative comparisons of HEFs and RTDs using both statistical tests and machine learning classification models. This data package includes the model inputs files and the simulation results data. This data package contains 10 folders. The modeling simulation results data are in the folders 100H_pt_data and 300area_pt_data, for the study domain Hanford 100H and 300 area respectively.

Columbia River, Washington, USA	In this study, we applied the one-way coupled river and subsurface water transport models to simulate the surface and subsurface water transport in two river sections on the Columbia River and the nearby inland regions, Hanford 100-H and 300 Area.

The particle transport times for all the released particles are summarized into residence time distributions for quantitatively evaluation of their similarity and transferability in the same HUs in the two regions. The detailed methods are introduced and discussed in the associated manuscript (Bao et al. 2024).

(2002) RFS and a water delivery system based on the Walnut Gulch (Paige et al., 2004) RFS. The NARS uses an aluminum frame that is fully deconstructable for transportation to field locations and a water system that enables variable rain intensity. Prior to field deployment, H-flume discharge and the corresponding Milone eTape Liquid Level Sensor (eTape) resistance values were measured in the laboratory so that discharge measurements from the NGEE Arctic Rainfall Simulator could be automated. eTape resistance was measured with increasing fluid heights for the full range of the eTape to calculate sensor detection limits and resolution. The eTape was calibrated to both a commercially available 12.2 cm HS-flume and a 3D printed 4 cm Micro-HS-flume. This data package contains two .csv files, one for the eTape calibration and the other for the flume calibrations, and two .stl files to 3D print the 4 cm Micro-HS-Flume design with a 1 cm x 3.6 cm stilling well opening. The .stl files can be opened in most 3D printing or CAD programs/software. Two .kml files of the laboratory location and broader area where testing was conducted are also included in this data package.

""	The Milone eTape Liquid Level Sensor (eTape) acts as a variable resistor; as fluid depth increases, resistance decreases. This sensor was calibrated so that discharge measurements from the NGEE Arctic Rainfall Simulator (NARS) could be automated. The eTape selected for our application had a sensor length of 120 mm. The eTape resistance values were initially measured in a 250 mL graduated cylinder with a 33 mm inner diameter to determine activation depth, the minimum fluid level necessary to cause changes in eTape resistance values, and sensitivity, the minimum change in fluid level to cause a change in the eTape resistance once the activation depth had been reached. The eTape was suspended from the bottom of the graduated cylinder by 1 mm. Water was added to the graduated cylinder in 0.5-5mL increments using a pipette; each additional mL of water added corresponds to ~1 mm increase of visual water height of the eTape (Table 1). The visual height of the water, mass of additional water, and eTape resistance was recorded and the total mass added and the net resistance (recorded resistance subtracted from eTape resistance at zero sensor depth) were calculated. Activation depth was determined from the minimum water depth on the eTape sensor before resistance values changed from the no fluid depth resistance value and the sensitivity was determined by the minimum increase in water height that changed the resistance values. The eTape was calibrated to a commercially available 12.2 cm HS-flume and two 3D printed 4 cm ?Micro?-HS-flumes. The first (Design #1) 3D printed 4cm Micro-HS-flume had an opening to the stilling well that was 0.64 cm x 0.64 cm; the second (Design #2) had a stilling well opening that was 1 cm x 3.6 cm. The calibrations for all flumes were completed in the same way. The flumes were leveled front to back and side to side with the flume spilling into a sink. The eTape was installed in each flume?s stilling well. In the 12.2 cm HS-flume, the eTape was taped to the side of the stilling well to prevent the sensor from floating or shifting. The 4 cm Micro-HS-flumes had a 2.54 cm diameter stilling well, which can support the eTape without adhesives. The eTape was primed with water past the activation depth in the stilling wells. In the 12.2 cm HS-flume, the eTape was primed to a depth of 68 mm, corresponding to the water depth when the top of the eTape is level with the top of the stilling well, and in the 4 cm Micro-HS-flumes, the eTape was primed to 28 mm. Tap water was run from a sink faucet through the flume. The discharge from the flume was collected using a 400 mL beaker. Discharge was increased in ~7 mL/s increments, limited from the coarseness of adjusting the faucet valve. The mass of the water was measured and then converted to volume. Discharge was calculated by dividing the volume of water in the beaker by the time required to reach that volume. Net eTape resistance was calculated by subtracting the measured eTape resistance from the eTape resistance at no discharge. The 4 cm Micro-HS-Flumes were 3D printed since commercially available flumes with these dimensions are not available. The Micro-HS-Flume was printed from 1.75 mm Tough PLA using a 0.6 mm nozzle installed on a Prusa i3 MK3 3D printer and sliced using PrusaSlicer software. The nozzle temperature was 220 °C for the duration of the print. The bed temperature was set to 65 °C for the first layer and then reduced to 60 °C for all following layers. The lightning infill pattern was used with a fill density set to 15%. The flume and the stilling well were printed separately and then glued after printing to ensure a solid bed layer. Overall, 240 g of PLA filament was used and printing required ~16.5 h.

Seward Peninsula, Alaska	"Collection of ground truth data for mapping of near-surface permafrost: Geophysical surveys were conducted at Teller 27 (TL27), Teller 47 (TL47), and Kougarok 64 (KG64) during the summers of 2018, 2019, and 2021 to identify locations of near-surface permafrost during the period of maximum seasonal thaw depth. Electrical resistivity was measured at four transects at TL27, two transects at KG64, and six transects at TL47 using either 98 or 112 electrodes spaced 2 meters apart. Measurements of soil temperature to 0.8 m depth were collated with the electrical resistivity. Samples with temperatures < 1.8 C were classified as permafrost, and when resistivity values were >3,000 ohms, the temperature threshold for classification increased to 2.4 C. Additional ground truth observations of near-surface permafrost presence were collected at Teller 47 during September 2021 and August 2022. The observations were made from soil profiles exposed in soil trenches, frost probing, and measurements of temperature at 0.75 to 1.20 m depth using a SpotOn temperature probe. Model training and development: Maps of the predicted extent of near-surface permafrost were generated in two ways. First, all of the training data were used from each of the sites, and a machine learning model was trained using an extremely randomized trees (ERTr) algorithm (Geurts, P., Ernst, D. & Wehenkel, L. Extremely randomized trees. Mach Learn 63, 3?42 (2006). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-006-6226-1). Inputs for both machine learning approaches were derived in part from the 2021 NGEE Arctic NCALM LiDAR dataset (https://doi.org/10.5440/1832016). The balanced accuracy of the ERTr model was 0.90, 0.92, and 0.86 for Teller 27, Teller 47, and Kougarok 64, respectively. Then, the transferability of a machine learning approach to predicting near-surface permafrost was assessed by training a support vector machine (Gunn, Steve R. ""Support vector machines for classification and regression."" ISIS technical report 14.1 (1998): 5-16) algorithm using data from two sites and transferring the model to the third site. For the transferred models, the balanced accuracies were 0.61, 0.64, and 0.75 for Teller 27, Teller 47, and Kougarok 64, respectively."

Understanding of groundwater-surface water interactions in montane systems in critical for the future of water availability in the Western US as groundwater contributions are expected to become more important for sustaining summer stream flows. This data package contains: (1) a csv of all radon samples; (2) a csv of all stream and spring isotope samples; (3) a csv of precipitation isotope samples; and (4) a csv of locations for each sampling site. The dataset additionally includes a file-level metadata (flmd.csv) file that lists each file contained in the dataset with associated metadata; and a data dictionary (dd.csv) file that contains column/row headers used throughout the files along with a definition, units, and data type.	The East River (ER) is a snow‐dominated, headwater basin of the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) located in the western United States. The ER is the designated testbed of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area (WFSFA). Through WFSFA, observational networks have been established to measure stream discharge and precipitation chemistry. The ER is considered representative of many snow‐dominated headwaters of the Rocky Mountains. The study domain encompasses nearly 85 square km, a 1.4‐km vertical drop in elevation (4,120 to 2,760 m) and pristine alpine, subalpine, montane, and riparian ecosystems. The ER contains high‐energy mountain streams to low‐energy meandering floodplains and is eroding primarily into the Cretaceous, carbon‐rich, marine shale of the Mancos Formation. Additional metadata on specific locations within the watershed are provided in the following related data package: Varadharajan C. et al. (2022) doi:10.15485/1660962	Field Sample Collection: Stream water was collected for radon analysis in 2L plastic bottles without headspace and spring water was collected in 500 mL plastic bottles (n=2) or 250 mL glass bottles (n=4) without headspace. Stream water was collected in large volume bottles to ensure accurate measurement and detection of 222Rn due to the relatively low concentration of 222Rn in stream water. Spring samples were collected in smaller bottles given the high concentration of 222Rn in groundwater and were collected in different bottle types due to bottle availability at the time of sampling. Each spring was sampled only once, and one duplicate stream water sample was collected with three of the six synoptic events. All samples were collected using a Grainger surface water pump (Model IL200P, RULE, Rye Brook, NY) powered by a 12V battery. Due to the large volume of water we needed to collect for 22Rn analysis, we designed a sampling scheme that pumped water from the thalweg to a 2L bottle onshore. The bottle was placed in a bucket with the tubing inside, filled, and capped underwater without headspace to minimize degassing of 222Rn and the cap was sealed with Parafilm™. We sampled springs similarly by placing the pump in the pool at the spring head or as close to the spring head such that the pump was completely submerged. Samples were shipped in coolers overnight to Lawrence Berkeley National Lab for 222Rn analysis. Stream and spring water were also collected for stable water isotope analysis. Water samples were filtered through a 0.45-micron Nylon filter into a 2 mL glass vial with Septa caps taking care to eliminate headspace and refrigerated until analysis. We relied on water isotopes of precipitation collected about 10 km north-east of Coal Creek during the 2021 water year as end members to compare stream and spring water isotopic composition. Samples were collected approximately weekly, and snow (n=23) and rain (n=10) samples were aggregated to assess seasonal variability in precipitation (Table S2). Rain gauges were made to U.S. Weather Bureau specifications with a capacity of 27.9 cm x 2 mm. Gauges were situated in areas sheltered from winds, attempting to maintain at least two lengths of surrounding tree height to avoid turbulence. Mineral oil was used to limit evaporative effects. Sample Analysis: Concentrations of 222Rn in the water samples were measured using a RAD7 instrument (mfd. by Durridge Co. Inc., Billerica MA). A closed loop system connected to the RAD7 (the RAD H20 for 2 L bottles - Durridge Co.) was used to sparge 222Rn for quantification within the instrument. After 15-minutes of sparging, counting began for 15-minute periods. After the first four counting periods (or one hour) the internal air pump of the RAD 7 was turned off, and counting continued for at least 10 counting periods, or a total counting time of at least 2.5 hours. The average temperature of the water sample during the sparging process was measured using a thermo-couple electronic thermometer (Thermapen MK4, ThermoWorks, USA) held to the bottle with a Velcro strap. This temperature was used to calculate the partitioning of 222Rn between the air-loop and the water sample. Between sample analyses, the entire system was purged for 15 minutes with the atmosphere to remove 222Rn from the system and reduce internal humidity. Statistical pooling of the counting periods for individual analyses was conducted using Isoplot (Ludwig, 2012). Measured 222Rn concentrations were corrected for radioactive decay to the time of sample collection (typically measurements were analyzed < 48 hrs. post sample collection). Average analytical uncertainty was 1.2 piC/L. 222Rn concentrations are reported in Table 2 as pCi/L. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of water were measured using an off‐axis integrated cavity output spectrometer coupled to an autosampler interfaced with a heated injector block (Los Gatos Research, San Jose, USA). Average analytical uncertainty for hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are 0.05 and 0.14 per mil, respectively. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios are reported in conventional δ notation relative to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water.

The ‘Locations.csv’ file contains the location of all sensors, given in NAD83 – UTM Zone 13N. ERT monitoring data has been processed to filter data based on reciprocal errors (data with errors > 30% were removed), a linear error model was fitted to each survey, and to ensure a constant set of measurements for time-lapse inversion, filtered data were interpolated and assigned a 100% measurement error. Soil moisture and temperature data were acquired at 15 min intervals, and averaged to provide 1h data. Weather data and borehole data (groundwater depth, conductivity and temperature) were acquired at 30 min intervals, and are provided as daily measurements; all measurements are averaged, except of precipitation values, which are given as daily accumulation. The hydrological model was set up along the ERT monitoring transect, and net infiltration was used as surface boundary condition and derived from the weather data. Four different results are provided, (1) results for a parameterization using hydraulic permeability and porosity as derived from the ERT data through petrophysical relationships, and (2) three simplified model results, using 1 to 3 geological layers above the bedrock. Modelling was performed using PFLOTRAN, and for each model the PFLOTRAN input files are provided. The result files include weekly hydrological modelling results (e.g., saturation, velocities, pressures), as well as the model parameterization.

Although a rich literature exist on studies of the influence of tidal waters on the biogeochemistry of coastal ecosystem soils, few studies have experimentally addressed the reverse question: How do soils (or sediments) from different coastal ecosystems influence the biogeochemistry of the tidal waters that inundate them? We conducted short-term microcosm laboratory experiments where seawater was amended with sediments and soils collected across regional gradients of inundation exposure (i.e., frequently to rarely inundated) and measured changes in dissolved oxygen and greenhouse gas concentrations to calculate gas consumption or production rates occurring during seawater exposure to terrestrial materials. This data package contains dissolved oxygen and greenhouse gas data collected during incubation of soils and sediments collected at 18 sites, which were used in the publication Regier et al. (2023) entitled “Coastal inundation regime moderates the short-term effects of sediment and soil additions on seawater oxygen and greenhouse gas dynamics: a microcosm experiment” which is published in Frontiers in Marine Science (DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1308590). --- Acknowledging EXCHANGE: General Support and Data Product Use We ask that users of EXCHANGE data add the following acknowledgement when publishing data in scholarly articles and data repositories: ""This research is based on work supported by COMPASS-FME, a multi-institutional project supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research as part of the Environmental System Science Program."""	Bounding box for EXCHANGE EC1 samples used for the microcosm experiment data included in this study.	Surface soil and sediment samples were collected as part of the first campaign from the Exploration of Coastal Hydrobiogeochemistry Across a Network of Gradients and Experiments (EXCHANGE) research consortium. Samples for this study were collected at 18 locations distributed throughout Chesapeake and Delaware Bays and their tributaries. At each site, EXCHANGE consortium members sampled four locations along a coastal terrestrial-aquatic interface transect spanning a gradient of inundation regimes: (1) frequently inundated sediment underlying shallow nearshore surface waters, 2) frequently inundated soils from wetlands; 3) rarely inundated soils from transitional forests with unhealthy trees (ghost forests); and 4) rarely inundated soils from upland forests that may have never been exposed to tidal inundation. We conducted laboratory incubation experiments to understand how amendments of soils or sediments collected across the inundation gradient of the coastal terrestrial-aquatic interface (i.e., the sampling site’s expected antecedent exposure to tidal inundation based on its location along the coastal terrestrial-aquatic interface) influenced seawater DO and GHG dynamics. To do this, we quantified the consumption or production of DO and GHGs during short-term (24-hour duration) incubations where seawater was mixed with a small quantity of soil or sediment. The day before each incubation, soil/sediment samples were taken out of the refrigerator to reach room temperature (~18 C) before incubating. We used fresh seawater collected from Sequim Bay, WA prior to each incubation as our consistent seawater source to reduce complexity and confounding factors associated with using water from each sampling site. For each sample, we filled triplicate combusted 40 mL amber borosilicate glass scintillation vials with gas-tight septum caps with ~5g of field-moist soil or sediment. We then added room-temperature seawater to the vial (which was equilibrated with the atmosphere by vigorously shaking a bottle with headspace for several minutes), leaving less than 1 mL of headspace. Each vial was then homogenized via shaking by hand for 60 seconds, and then incubated at ~18 ºC in the dark for 24 hours. We measured dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations every minute for 24 hours using optical sensors attached to a 4-channel hub (Firesting FS02-C4, Aachen, Germany). DO consumption rates in µM/hr were then calculated based on [DOinitial – DOfinal] / [timefinal – timeinitial], where DOinitial is the DO concentration in µM at the start of the experiment, DOfinal is the DO concentration in µM at the end of the experiment, and timeinitial and timefinal are the corresponding times relative to the start of the experiment. After a 24-hour incubation period, we sampled GHGs from all incubations. Gases were first extracted from 20 mL of water collected from the top of each vial. The water was carefully poured into a 60 mL syringe without bubbling and filled with 40 mL of N2 to perform a headspace extraction following methods by Ward et al. (2019). The partial pressures in parts per million (ppm) of CO2, CH4, and N2O were measured using a Picarro G2508 Cavity Ring‐Down Spectrometer with a flow limiter to reduce gas flow rates. GHG rates were calculated in the same way as DO rates.

We trained random forest machine learning models to predict snow depth from temperature data recorded at or just below the ground surface. Training data was collected at the Teller 27 Watershed and Kougarok 64 Hillslope during the 2021 - 2022 water year on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska using distributed temperature profiling (DTP) systems. We then applied this model to other sites where ground surface or shallow soil temperature data was available for at least one water year (see Related Datasets). Many of these temperature measurements were collocated with snow depth observations. Ground surface temperature (i.e. snow-ground interface temperature) is easy to measure using small, cheap and easy-to-deploy temperature sensors such as iButtons and TinyTags, and such measurements have previously been used to calculate a variety of snow metrics (e.g. snow onset date). However, this is the first study to estimate snow depth directly from ground surface temperature data. The present dataset contains one *.csv file which includes machine learning snow depth predictions at sites in Alaska, Norway, Siberia, Colorado, and New Mexico and one *.kml file including the locations of sites with snow depth predictions. No training data predictions are included in the *.csv file.

Teller 27 Field Site, Seward Peninsula, Alaska	Machine Learning Models We trained two random forest machine learning models to predict snow depth based off of ground surface or shallow soil temperature measurements. Due to biases in training data, the model rarely predicts snow depth over 1.4 m. The motivation behind this approach is that with increasing snow depth, ground surface temperature becomes less variable. Both models are trained using data collected at the NGEE Arctic Teller 27 and Kougarok 64 study sites on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska. The models are described below: 1. RF-Seward. This model was trained using ground surface temperature measurements collected at the snow-ground interface and above any insulating ground cover vegetation. 2. RF-Below. This model was trained using shallow soil temperature data located 1 - 5 cm below the soil surface and below any insulating ground cover vegetation. This model performs worse than RF-Seward, likely due to variable vegetation insulating the subsurface differently. Model training The machine learning models are trained using data collected by distributed temperature profiling systems (DTPs) which record temperature in 5 cm intervals both above and below the soil surface. Ground surface temperature, soil temperature, and snow depth can be derived from DTPs (see Figure 1). Although trained using DTP data, this model is easily applied to temperature data collected using miniature temperature sensors (e.g. iButtons). Model Design The random forest model makes predictions for each day independently given features calculated for that day from temperature data. The features included in the model are: -maximum ground surface temperature -ground surface temperature range (maximum - minimum) -30-day average of ground surface temperature standard deviation prior to a given day -30-day average of ground surface temperature standard deviation surrounding a given day -30-day average of ground surface temperature standard deviation following a given day Evaluation Sites The machine learning model was applied to several evaluation sites across Alaska, Colorado, New Mexico, Norway, and Siberia (see Fig 2). Details for each site are given in Table 2 of the User Guide document. Predictions made at each site are included in this dataset.

To better characterize shrub heights based on landscape position, proximity to surface waters, and species, shrub heights were measured with a differential GPS (dGPS) at the Teller 27 and Kougarok 64 field sites on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska. Measurements were collected between September 12th through 16th, 2021. Shrub heights were calculated by subtracting the maximum height of the canopy from the ground elevation. Some of the shrub heights collected were co-located with iButton (i.e., K45, B8) and Tiny Tag (i.e., TT10) sensors in dataset NGA296. Other shrub heights and species were measured in a dense 20 m x 20 m plot to understand shrub density, species composition, and heights.

Teller 27 Field Site, Seward Peninsula, Alaska	In September 2021, 176 shrub heights were measured with an Emlid Reach RS2 dGPS unit (Emlid Tech Kft., Budapest, Hungary) using a multi-band RTK GNSS. The equipment consisted of a roving dGPS receiver and associated mobile application Emlid Flow as well as a base station at a well-surveyed location with known OPUS corrections (644316.16696 [0.009 m resolution], -1655630.68794 [0.001 m resolution], 60.855 m elevation [0.005 m resolution]). The handheld dGPS receiver and application was used to measure the maximum canopy height and ground elevation of each shrub. A 20 x 20 m plot was established to characterize the density and species composition of all shrub canopies (n=57) within this plot at the Teller 27 field site. At Kougarok 64, 54 shrub heights measured, and 122 shrub heights were measured at Teller 27. Base station location was previously corrected, and this location was used to correct the raw dGPS points using Emlid’s associated software, Emlid Studio. Shrub heights were derived by subtracting the maximum canopy height from the ground elevation, correcting for the length of the pole on which the dGPS receiver is mounted. The dGPS unit collected 75 samples averaged during approximately 14 seconds to find a precise dGPS location.

HEADER: Below methods text was primarily retrieved from the BEO_Thaw_Depth_Frost_Table_Area_*_information.txt file with minor modifications. FIELD MEASUREMENTS: Elevations are given as absolute elevation (meters above sea level) via a detailed level surveying of each grid point to a known benchmark. A permanent wooden stake marked each grid corner, which was surveyed with a Differential GPS system by Craig Ulrich in Sep. 2012. The start of each transect, which was located 0.5 m apart, was also marked with a wooden stake. During each survey, a meter tape was secured to each transect's end-point and an elevation/thaw depth was measured every 0.5 m along the meter tape. The elevation survey was made using the digital level TopCon DL-502. The known benchmark/reference elevation was surveyed at the beginning and at the end of each survey. Note that the ground elevation, especially moss-covered, is difficult to determine within ~5 cm. A pointed 1.25m long and 1 cm diameter metal probe was used to determine thaw depth. The ground surface elevation was surveyed with the digital level and rod, while the thaw depth and water level was measured locally with the rod (water) and probe (thaw). The grid survey at Area B took ~1.5h. The grid survey at Area C took ~4h. The grid survey at Area D took ~5h. DATA PROCESSING: All values were processed to represent absolute elevation (meter above sea level). Water surface elevation measurements were averaged within respective polygon feature. The value is only reported at locations where surface inundation was observed. The location coordinates (x and y) were presented as relative values in the field, but translated into UTM coordinates using linear interpolation from the DGPS grid corner coordinates. COMMENTS (Area B): The extent of the surveyed area was increased in 2013. In September 2012 the area was 1 meter wide by 7.5 meters long. In 2013, we added 4 meters of length and 2 meters of width. Thus, the size of the survey area in all surveys except for the September 2012 survey is 3 meters wide by 11.5 meters long. COMMENTS (Area C): The extent of the surveyed area was increased in 2013. In September 2012 the area was 11 meters wide by 9.5 meters long. In 2013, we added 4 meters of length. Thus, the size of the survey area in all surveys except the September 2012 survey is 11 meters wide by 13.5 meters long. Survey in September 2013 was conducted with a large amount of standing frozen water present. Thus, while the frost table could be readily derived from the thaw depth with respect to surveyed surface of ground, the surveyed surface of the ground in most cases was not the actual ground surface. Therefore, in the data for the September 2013 survey, the ground surface elevations given in this sheet are those determined during the July 2013 survey, and the thaw depths reflect that adjustment. In addition, for that survey, no water surface measurements are given due to the impossibility of distinguishing ice and ground. Three independent water tables exist in Area C; one in each polygon, and one in trough. Water measurements were only taken where standing water was observed. These measurements were then averaged across the individual water table (e.g. all water surface measurements taken in the trough were averaged across each other, but not with those taken in either polygon). The average measurements are then reported at each location where a measurement was recorded. COMMENTS (Area D): The extent of the surveyed area in all seasons was 9 meters wide by 12.5 meters long. Two independent water tables exist in Area D (one in each polygon). Water measurements were only taken where standing water was observed. These measurements were then averaged across the individual water table (e.g. all water surface measurements taken in one polygon were averaged across each other, but not with those taken in the other polygon). The average measurements are then reported at each location where a measurement was recorded. The “BEO_Thaw_Depth_Frost_Table_Area_*_information_Plot_1” JPEGs show a section of the LiDAR DEM (grayscale) for Area B, C, and D, along with the surveyed ground surface elevation (color) from 2013 and 2014, respectively. Red/black and blue/white indicate low and high areas, respectively. Note that elevations obtained by the ground survey are more accurate than those shown by the LiDAR DEM.

These data were collected in July 2018 at a field site near mile marker 64 along the Kougarok road (Nome-Taylor Highway) between Nome, Alaska and Taylor, Alaska. A DJI Matrice 600 Pro Airframe and Routescene UAV LiDARSystem was used to collect LiDAR data. The LiDAR data has undergone basic post-processing using Routescene LidarViewer Pro software to create point cloud data (.laz files). This data package contains point clouds (.laz), processing metadata files (json.lvp), and post-processed kinematic files (.csv). Ancillary aircraft data, flight mission parameters, weather conditions, raw LiDAR data, and RGB imagery can be found in NGA298. The Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments: Arctic (NGEE Arctic), was a research effort to reduce uncertainty in Earth System Models by developing a predictive understanding of carbon-rich Arctic ecosystems and feedbacks to climate. NGEE Arctic was supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska. Through observations, experiments, and synthesis with existing datasets, NGEE Arctic provided an enhanced knowledge base for multi-scale modeling and contributed to improved process representation at global pan-Arctic scales within the Department of Energy's Earth system Model (the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, or E3SM), and specifically within the E3SM Land Model component (ELM).	NGEE Arctic Kougarok Site, Mile Marker 64, Alaska	Point cloud data derived from raw .lpd files using Routescene LidarViewer Pro software. Spatial information is included in each point cloud and minor corrections have been applied using user-derived roll, pitch and yaw (RPY) offset values, filtering, and Advanced Navigation Kinematica software georeference correction files. See filtering methods and parameters sections for more information on filtering applied and flight-specific parameters used. Basic processing of .lpd files was completed using Routescene LidarViewer Pro software. Flights were trimmed by defining start and end points within the flight to exclude flight sections with turns and portions where the flight path did not follow the same horizontal direction of the main flight sections . This was done to reduce overlap of lower-accuracy points in the generated point cloud. Roll, pitch, and yaw inertial navigation system offset corrections were determined and applied to each flight on the order of +/- one degree for each parameter. Minimal filtering was used to produce the .laz files using the following filter chain run in parallel: ● Dual Return Reduction ● Range Reduction (Hide outer points = True, Range (m) = see Table 1) ● Laser ID Reduction (Laser IDs = 0,2,4) ● Coordinate Projection (Projection File = EPSG 32603) ● LAS Export (Compressed = True, Position = Projection, EPSG Reference = 32603, Points per file = 0) Individual raw .lpd files from the Routescene LidarPod were imported into Routescene LidarViewer Pro software. Because the .lpd file format is only accessible through this software, minimal processing was done on the data to produce .laz point cloud files to produce L1 data. First, for each flight, the post- processed kinematic file was produced by using the Advanced Navigation Kinematica software, using inputs of the Routescene base station’s .rinex file(s), and the .anpp file extracted from the .lpd file using either a custom Python script, or Advanced Navigation Spatial Dual Manager software. The .csv output of Kinematica software was then imported into LidarViewer Pro and applied as corrections to the point cloud. Next, roll, pitch, and yaw (RPY) values were determined for each flight manually using the Profile tool and the Offsets tab in LidarViewer Pro, and then applied as corrections to the point cloud. RPY corrections are necessary to improve vertical and horizontal alignment of adjacent flight lines (boresight alignment), as well as vertical spread of points in a single flight line. See Table 1 for the RPY values used for each flight. Start and end points were then manually determined in order to exclude UAV turns, figure-8 maneuvers, flight lines that were not parallel to the main flight lines, and takeoffs and landings. See Table 1 or startFrame and endFrame values in .json.lvp files for retained sections of each flight. Finally, filtering as described in L1 Filtering Methods was completed, and a corrected, filtered L1 ***_PointCloud.laz file was exported from LidarViewer Pro.

Both visual and ground-based observations were made for patches of alder shrublands greater 5x5m and larger, ideally 10x10m so that full coverage within in a 5x5m mapping pixel was assured. Visual observations were made from the car and GPS coordinates are approximate, placed by dropping pins on georeferenced pdfs using the Avenza app. Visual observations included positive identified alder shrublands as well as thickets of non-alder shrubs and trees that we anticipated map products having difficulty differentiating from alder shrublands.

Ground observations include GPS points (made with Garmin InReach) as well as relevant features of a centrally located, representative alder shrub in the patch (max height, basal diameter of all ramets, soil depth). Max height was measured as the vertical distance from the ground to the highest point on the tallest ramet using an aluminum avalanche pole with markings every centimeter. Basal diameter was measured on each ramet using digital calipers. Soil depth was measured at four locations surrounding the surveyed alder by pushing a tile probe (permafrost thaw depth probe) into the soil as far as it would go. At each depth we recorded depth in centimeters and whether the probe hit frozen ground or rock, differentiated by the texture and sound the probe made. The probe was 120cm long so soil profiles deeper than the probe are denoted with ""-9999"" in the data with a comment specifying the reason. Aboveground biomass (weight dry mass) of the surveyed ground observation shrubs was calculated based on basal diameter per ramet and alder-specific allometric equations in Berner et al 2015 which our team checked for accuracy for the Seward Peninsula as part of Salmon et al 2019."

NGEE Arctic Teller Site, Mile Marker 27, Alaska	"Sampling Plans Figures referenced are in the PDF documentation. Snow Depth Surveys Snow depths were taken along survey transects at approximately 20 meter intervals (Appendix Figure 2). Adjacent to iButton nests, snow depth was captured every 5 meters. Box and grid surveys were performed at each iButton nest. Depth was also recorded at 5-meter intervals but in the shape of either a box around the cluster or a grid going through the site (Appendix Figure 1). Zigzag or X-shaped surveys, also with depth recorded at 5-meter intervals but in the shape of a zigzag or an ""X"", were performed at select iButton sites (Appendix Figure 1). Snow Physical Measurements Every ~300m along survey transects, three or more integrated snow density measurements were taken with snow tubes with known cross-sectional area and snow depth (to determine snow volume) and weighed. These snow density and snow depth measurements were then used to estimate SWE for each site. Around iButton clusters and IS sites, snow density was measured at 1 to 3 locations.? At each snow density measurement location, two temperature probes were inserted, one close to the snow surface and the other touching the ground, to measure snow temperature. After allowing the temperature probes time to equilibrate, snow temperatures were recorded. Snow Depth In 2022, snow depth data were collected using a Snow-Hydro MagnaProbe (Figure 1) which measures the snow depth and GPS location at a point. GPS location on the MagnaProbe instrument is measured with a Garmin GPS16X-HVS with 3-5 m accuracy. Snow depth was measured approximately every 20m along planned transect lines. To protect the instrument from damage, a thaw probe was used to penetrate through the snowpack prior to depth measurement. Where snow depth was greater than 130 cm (surpassing the length of the MagnaProbe), a depth of 0 cm was recorded on the instrument and the actual depth, as measured by inserting the avalanche probe into the snowpack, was recorded in field books. After data from the instrument were downloaded, post-processing included correcting 0 cm depths with the actual depths recorded in field books. Additionally, several distinct ice layers were present in the spring 2022 snowpack, which prevented surveyors from reaching the ground surface in some areas when snow depth was being measured. Where ice layers impacted snow depth measurements, record IDs were recorded infield notes and inaccurate snow depths were removed from the dataset in post-processing. Calibration At the start of each day and sometimes at the conclusion of each day the instrument was run through a calibration check. This is a simple diagnostic procedure. The two measurements are recorded to simulate a snow depth of 0 cm followed by two measurements at the upper limit, about 130 cm. During post-processing, values are separated from the primary data set. Any variation due to hysteresis or other error can be tracked and, if needed, the main snow data set can be adjusted for any changes in the boundary limits. Measurements Integrated SWE Measurements Data used to calculate SWE were collected using a Snow-Hydro snow tube (areas = 30 cm2). The snow tube is inserted through the snowpack (Figure 2) and into the underlying soil organic layer. The snow tube is twisted until a ""plug"" (organic material) is obtained. The plug is necessary to prevent snow loss during removal of the snow tube. Prior to twisting the snow tube into the organic layer, the snow depth is recorded from hatchmarks on the snow tube. In the event that a plug does not form at the bottom of the tube, a snowpit is dug adjacent to the snow tube to allow for removal at a small angle and minimize snow loss from the bottom of the snow tube. After extracting the snow tube, the snow tube is inverted to catch the snow in a plastic bag. The weight of the bag and snow was recorded. SWE is calculated with the equation from (Stuefer et al. 2013) (See documentation for more on equation). Temperature For 2022, snow temperature data were collected using an Omega Thermistor Meter. Snow temperature was recorded just below the snow surface (at a depth of approximately 2 cm) and at the base of the snowpack. Snow pits were used to reach depths that are deeper than the length of the snow temperature probe. Depth of the measurement is the distance from the snow surface to the ground surface."

Environmental measurements include: mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and 30-day presampling temperature. Soil physicochemical measurements include: particle size analysis (PSA), pH, gravimetric moisture content (GMC), bulk soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), total organic C and N, C:N ratio, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Soil biological measurements include: microbial biomass carbon (MBC) measured through chloroform fumigation extraction (CFE), gene copy numbers (GCN) of bacteria, fungi, and archaea measured through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), DNA yield measured through Nanodrop spectrophotometry, and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) of bacteria and fungi measured through PLFA analysis. This data set contains one file in comma separate (*.csv) format.	Global	Soil treatment and characterization Soil samples were stored at -20 oC for up to five days before being sieved (2 mm) and subsampled (n = 3) for analyses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), MBC, dry weight, and extraction of DNA. MEF bog qPCR and PLFA subsamples were stored at -80 oC prior to analysis. Total organic C (TOC) concentrations were determined by the same method after treating samples with 3M HCl for 1 hr. Particle size analysis for soil texture was evaluated with the Bouyoucos hydrometer method (Gee and Or, 2002). Soil pH was determined by shaking 1 part soil in 2 parts Milli-Q water and measuring the pH of the supernatant. Subsamples (n = 3) of 7 g fresh soil were used to measure DOC for each soil type. The soil was combined with 0.035L of 0.5 M K2SO4, and the samples were shaken on an orbital reciprocating shaker for 1 hour. Afterward, the soil suspensions were gravity filtered with Whatman No. 42 filter paper, and the extracts were immediately stored at -20° C. The extracts were analyzed using the Shimadzu Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) to obtain values for DOC. Microbial community characterization Microbial biomass by chloroform fumigation-extraction Subsamples (n = 3) of 7 g fresh soil were thawed from -20° C and fumigated with chloroform for a total of 48 h at 25° C. The fumigated soil was then combined with 0.035 L of 0.5 M K2SO4, and treated identically to the DOC extractions in Section 2.1. On a subset of soils we measured MBC on fresh, never frozen soil samples and obtained similar values within standard error of the samples frozen at -20°C prior to fumigation. Although extraction efficiency will vary by individual soil, an E_C of 0.45 was applied here, as this is a standard value typically applied in the literature for mineral soils (Fierier et al., 2009; Vance at al., 1987). PLFA analysis Lipid analysis was performed according to an adaptation of the Bligh and Dyer (1959) method outlined in Gray et al. (2011). Extractions were performed on freeze-dried 2-g subsamples using a 1:2:0.8 ratio of chloroform, methanol, and phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Water and chloroform were then added after three hours to produce a phase separation isolating total lipids in the chloroform layer. Phospholipids were separated using silicic acid column chromatography, then saponified and methylated using an alkaline solution to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Dried phospholipids were then reconstituted using a known concentration of FAME 19:0 as an internal standard to quantify PLFA concentrations. Samples from the Marcell Bog were processed using a modified Bligh and Dyer (1959) method modified for peat extractions (Blake, 2017). In contrast to the previously described method (Gray et al., 2011), a 1:1:0.9 ratio of chloroform, methanol, and citrate buffer (pH 4.0) was used to isolate total lipids and samples were not saponified prior to methylation. Nomenclature of fatty acids adheres to Frostegård et al. (1993). Specific PLFAs were used to quantify relative abundance of bacterial and fungal biomass. Calculations of total PLFAs comprise fatty acids with less than 20 Cs (Zelles, 1999). Bacterial biomass calculations included the sum of fatty acids 14:0, i15:0, a15:0, 15:0, i16:0, 16:0, 16:1w7, 10me16:0, i17:0, a17:0, cy17:0, 18:2w7, 18:0, 10me18:0, cy19:0a (Zelles, 1999), while fungal biomass is represented by the sum of 18:2w6 (Zelles, 1999) and 18:1w9 (Zak et al., 1996). Microbial DNA yield and gene copy numbers with qPCR Subsamples (n = 3) of each soil type were stored at -80° C, and microbial DNA was extracted from 0.25 g of soil using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MOBIO Laboratories, Inc., CA, USA) or the E.Z.N.A. Soil DNA Kit (Omega Biotek, Norcross, GA, USA) for the SPRUCE peat histosols. The concentration and purity of the extracted DNA was measured using the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.). The same general approach outlined by Fierer et al., (2005) was then used to quantify GCN on a dry weight basis for bacteria, fungi, and archaea (Table 3). Analyses for each soil were conducted in analytical triplicate and set up in clear 96-well plates. Each qPCR reaction consisted of 19 µl of MasterMix—5 µl H2O, 2 µl of forward primer, 2 µl of reverse primer, and 10 µl of SYBR Green SuperMix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.)—combined with 1 µl of extracted microbial DNA. Pure culture standards of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Methanococcus maripaludis of known DNA concentration were diluted to 1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000, and 1:10,000 and were used to generate a standard linear curve relating the log of the GCN to the measured threshold value (Ct). This standard curve was then used to convert sample threshold values measured on a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., CA, USA) into GCN g-1 dry soil.

Results were collected using quantitative molecular analysis of bulk soil carbon to assess the stability of soil organic carbon following whole-ecosystem warming and exposure to elevated carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO2). Targeted soil organic carbon components include solvent-extractable compounds (alkanoic acids, alkanols, alkanes, steroids, and terpenoids), ester-bound hydrolysable biopolymers (cutin and suberin markers), lignin phenols, and pyrogenic carbon. Bulk peat samples were analysed by Soxhlet extraction and solid phase separation for solvent-extractable compounds, alkaline hydrolysis to extract hydrolysable biopolymers, copper (II) oxide oxidation to extract lignin phenols and benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCAs) as an approximation of pyrogenic carbon. Samples were analysed by gas chromatography (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and compound identification was performed on GC coupled to mass selective detector (MS) for solvent-extractable compounds, ester-bound hydrolysable biopolymers and lignin phenols, and high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) for pyrogenic carbon. Results are presented in Ofiti et al. (accepted). The experimental work was conducted on samples collected in August 2018 at the SPRUCE climate manipulation experiment in northern Minnesota, 40 km north of Grand Rapids, in the USDA Forest Service Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF). Samples were collected and later analysed in a 10 cm increments over 0 to 50 cm depth and 25 cm intervals from 50 to 75 cm. Samples were analyzed for lignin phenols over 0 to 30 cm depth. This data set contains one file in comma separate (*.csv) format.

Climate warming and elevated CO2 rapidly alter peatland soil carbon sources and stability. Nat Commun 14, 7533. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43410-z.	SPRUCE Experiment Site	Study Site: Observations occurred at The Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s SPRUCE (Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments) project (Hanson et al., 2017) at S1 bog at the U.S. Forest Service’s Marcell Experimental Forest, in Minnesota, USA (47°30.476’ N; 93°27.162’ W). SPRUCE is an ecosystem-scale study that warms the vegetation and peatland soil profile to a depth of 2 m within 12.8-m diameter open-top enclosures. The peat was heated first at – 2 m for a period of 1 year starting in summer 2014 (deep peat heating phase), then heating of the overlying air began in August 2015 starting the whole ecosystem warming phase of the experiment. Methods are summarized below for additional details, please see the related publication: Ofiti et al (accepted). On 2018-08-14, peat core samples from 0-75 cm were collected in SPRUCE experiment plots. Samples later underwent a suite of complementary biogeochemical described below. Solvent-extractable compounds: Bulk peat samples (milled) were subjected to Soxhlet extraction. The extracts were sequentially separated into low-polarity and acid (alkanoic acid) fractions. The low-polar fractions were further separated into aliphatic hydrocarbons (including alkanes, steranes and hopanes), polycyclic aromatic compounds, and hetero-compounds (including alcohols, sterols and steranes). The alkanoic acid fraction was derivatized to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) prior to analysis. Given that alkanes, alkanoic acids, alkanols, steroids and terpenoids showed similar responses, we summed them to represent solvent-extractable compounds. Hydrolysable biopolymers: After pre-extraction of the solvent-extractable compounds, peat residues were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis to extract ester-bound hydrolysable lipids (including cutin and suberin markers). Solvent‐extracted residues were refluxed to extract hydrolysable biopolymers. An aliquot of the extracts was derivatized prior to analysis. Lignin phenols:Bulk peat samples (milled) were subjected to copper (II) oxide (CuO) oxidation to extract lignin phenols. An aliquot of the oxidation products was converted to trimethylsilyl derivatives prior to analysis. Lignin-specific oxidation products were used to calculate lignin oxidation indices; acid-to-aldehyde ratios of vanillyl and syringyl phenols. The above molecular compounds (solvent-extractable compounds, hydrolysable biopolymers, and lignin phenols) were quantified on gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Compound identification was performed on gas chromatography coupled to mass selective detector (GC-MS). Pyrogenic carbon: Benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCAs) were used as an approximation of pyrogenic carbon (PyC). Milled peat samples were digested with nitric acid. The extracts were filtered and passed over a cation exchange resin and a solid phase extraction cartridge. Compounds were quantified on a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). All carboxyl functional groups (B3CA, B4CA, B5CA and B6CA) were summed to represent total concentration of PyC.

""	Hydrosense Data We used a Hydrosense soil water meter to measure volumetric water content (VWC) of soil as a percentage based on m^3/m^3. Measurements were taken monthly across all study plots. The soil moisture probe was inserted fully into the soil within the dripline of each of three Pinus ponderosa saplings in each study plot. Three readings were taken at three locations within the dripline of each tree. Weather Station Data Campbell Scientific PC400 Datalogger connected to sensors: Vaisala HMP45C (7-wire, cable switched power) Temperature and Relative Humidity Sensor Licor LI200X Pyranometer Texas Electronics TE525(WS) Tipping Rain Gauge Met One 034A/034B Wind Speed and Direction Sensor Measurements were logged for: Date and time, battery voltage, air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, precipitation, wind speed and wind direction. Each datalogger was contained in a metal munitions box for protection against the elements. A system of three weather station locations across the study site provided redundancy to ensure a continuous feed of weather data would be available if errors occurred within any datalogger unit or sensor array. For the most part, two of the three dataloggers collected data simultaneously during the 2022 and 2023 field seasons. Soil Moisture Probes Either the solar-charging Zentra ZL6 data logger or the battery poweredEm50® series, ECH20 System logger, both produced by the METER Group, were installed in all active study plots and connected to METER TEROS 10, TEROS 21, Decagon 5TE and 5TM, and METER or Decagon EC-5 sensors to measure soil volumetric water content (m³/m³) and temperature (°C) with one probe installed at a depth of 15 cm, within the dripline of each of the three Pinus ponderosa saplings, usually less than 80cm from trunk, and facing South of each tree. Loggers were programmed to take readings every 15 minutes. Data downloads were recovered monthly during the field season. EC-5 Soil Moisture, m³/m³ VWC °C Logger Temperature 5TE, 5TM m³/m³ VWC Moisture/Temp/EC, °C Temp Onset HOBO Shade Plot Air Temperature Data (2022) One data logger and three sensors were installed to record air temperature in two plots. In the Drought-Shade Plot 30, two sensors were placed above the drought shelter at 150 cm, one in the Manipulated tree and one in the Response tree. And one sensor was placed below the drought shelter in the Response tree at 50 cm height. In the Ambient-Shade Plot 10, sensors were placed at the same heights and configuration as plot 30, but without the drought shelter set-up. 10 June 2022, HOBO air temperature/RH loggers were activated in one drought-shade (plot 30) and one ambient-shade (plot 10). Three sensors each plot: ‘Manipulated tree above plastic at 150cm ‘Response tree above plastic at 150cm Response tree below plastic at 50cm” “25 July 2022, installed shade nets” “15 October 2022 - Alex retrieved drought shelter plastic and stored at ECOR to dry over winter and retrieved HOBO air temperature sensors” iButton Air Temperature Data Embedded Data Systems Thermocron DSDS1921G-F5 iButton Temperature Data Loggers were used to record air temperatures above and below drought shelters in all drought treatment plots.

Spectra were collected in July 2022 using a handheld SVC HR-2014i spectroradiometer. All spectra were collected as calibrated surface radiance and converted to surface reflectance using 99.99% reflective Spectralon white reference standard. This data package includes unprocessed instrument output of the spectra signals (.sig) and, for some canopy measurements, photographs of the target taken by the SVC instrument camera or handheld digital camera (.jpg), GPS locations and file metadata (.csv).

The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska. Through observations, experiments, and synthesis with existing datasets, NGEE Arctic provided an enhanced knowledge base for multi-scale modeling and contributed to improved process representation at global pan-Arctic scales within the Department of Energy's Earth system Model (the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, or E3SM), and specifically within the E3SM Land Model component (ELM).	Teller MM 27 site and Kougarok Fire Complex (KFC) site, Seward Peninsula, AK, USA	An SVC HR-2014i handheld spectroradiometer (Spectra Vista Corporation, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA; spectral range: 350–2500 nm) fitted with a 8-degree field-of-view fore optic lens was used to measure the canopy reflectance of 104 monoculture plant species patches and 3 plots at Teller MM27, as well as of 65 locations along a fire disturbance transect at KFC. For monoculture species, 5 spectra were collected over the canopy of each sample to account for spectral variation within the canopy. Similarly, spectra at 17 locations were collected in each plot to represent spectral variation within the plot. The center coordinates of each monoculture and four corner coordinates of each plot were recorded using a handheld Trimble Geo7x differential global positioning system (dGPS) to augment the geospatial accuracy for synthesis with NGEE-Arctic and NASA ABoVE airborne data. For disturbance transect measurements at KFC, spectra at 65 locations along a transect covering both burned and unburned areas were collected. At each location, the spectroradiometer was positioned vertically, and 4 or 5 measurements were made following calibration using a 99.99%% reflective Spectralon white reference standard. The sample IDs for monoculture species may be cross referenced to the species spreadsheet included in this data package, and samples in other data packages, including leaf gas exchange (see related reference).

Summer active layer depths and temperatures at the top of the permafrost were collected at the Teller 47 field site on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska to better understand permafrost thermal state in areas of discontinuous permafrost. Measurements were taken between August 14th and August 20th, 2022. Active layer depths were measured with a 120 cm thaw probe, and temperature measurements were taken with a SpotOn Temperature probe at the top of permafrost and at a maximum depth of XYZ, when no near-surface permafrost (within 120 cm of the surface) was present. Measurements were co-located with ground surface displacement measurements, which can be found in the associated dataset, NGA254. Precise location data were collected at each observation point using a GNSS RTK GPS unit. This dataset contains a *.csv file of permafrost temperature and active layer depths and a *.kml file of measurement locations.

Teller 47 field site in the Seward Peninsula in Alaska.	Between August 14th – 20th in 2022, temperature at top of permafrost was measured at previously established survey locations, which can be found in NGA254 (Lathrop et al. 2022). Temperatures were measured with a SpotOn temperature probe, which has an accuracy of 0.8°C, and was calibrated to 0°C in ice water. Temperature measurements were collected to a depth of 0.75 – 1.20 m depth. At each temperature measurement location, active layer depth was also measured using a soil/frost probe. A measurement of 120 cm indicates that no near-surface permafrost was detected. Precise location data were collected at each observation point using a GNSS RTK GPS unit.

Petri dishes were placed in a grid within the NARS plot. Simulated rainfall was collected in each petri dish and the intensity and uniformity of the simulator was subsequently calculated. This data package contains two .csv files, one that summarizes the rainfall intensity and uniformity for each experiment, the other that contains individual petri dish water volume and intensity for each plot location and experiment. The Python scripts to control NARS are also included. The NGEE Arctic Rainfall Simulator (NARS) is a variable intensity rainfall simulator (RFS) with a frame design based on the Humphry et al. (2002) RFS and a water delivery system based on the Walnut Gulch (Paige et al., 2004) RFS. The NARS uses an aluminum frame that is fully deconstructable for transportation to field locations and a water system that enables variable rain intensity. Rain intensity control and data collection are automated using a Raspberry Pi microcomputer.

""	Petri dishes were placed in a uniform grid pattern beneath the NGEE Arctic Rainfall Simulator (NARS) plot area. Single nozzle and double nozzle configurations were tested. 46 petri dishes were placed in an 8 x 6 grid over the 1.9 m x 1.45 m rectangular plot in the single nozzle configuration and 96 petri dishes were placed in an 8 x 12 grid over the 1.9 m x 2.9 m rectangular plot in the double nozzle configuration. The petri dishes have a gauge area of 56.7 cm2. The NARS was run at full intensity for 1.5 minutes, the time it took for the petri dishes to fill. The pre- and post-run masses of the petri dishes were measured to calculate the volume of captured rainfall. Intensity was calculated following Eq. 1: IP=10[(i=1nViAg)n × 60t] (1) where IP is the plot average intensity in mm/h; Vi is the volume of the ith gauge in cm3; Ag is the gauge collection area in cm2; t is the time of each run in minutes; and n is the number of gauges; the coefficient of 10 converts measurements from cm/h to mm/h (Tossell et al., 1987). Uniformity was measured in a similar way as intensity. The measured volume in each dish will be used to calculate the uniformity coefficient in Eq. 2: UC=100(1.0-i=1n|Xi|mn) (2) where UC is the uniformity coefficient as a percentage; Xi is the deviation from mean m; and n is the number of gauges used. The average volumes of nearby petri dishes were used to calculate water volume if a petri dish was tipped, spilled or obstructed by vegetation.

NGEE Arctic Teller Site, Mile Marker 27, Alaska	Snow Depth Surveys: -Snow depths were taken along survey transects at 1 to 2 meter intervals next to intensive sites and iButton nests. Transects ranged in length from 150 m to 700 m depending on the site. -A grid survey was performed at Intensive Site 2. Depth was recorded at 2-meter intervals in the shape of a grid going through the site. -Zigzag or Triangle-shaped surveys, also with depth recorded at 1 to 2-meter intervals, were performed at intensive sites, snow cameras, and iButton nests. Snow Physical Measurements: Depending on the type of site being surveyed, the following two methods were used to collect snow density and SWE measurements in 2023: - Around iButton clusters and IS sites, snow density was measured at 1 to 3 locations. At each location, three or more integrated snow density measurements were taken with snow tubes with known cross-sectional area and snow depth (to determine snow volume) and weighed. These snow density and snow depth measurements were then used to estimate SWE for each site. - At each snow camera location, 1 to 3 snow density pits were dug to collect density profile data. Temperature probes were inserted within each layer of the snowpack, and after allowing the temperature probes time to equilibrate, snow temperatures were recorded. Snow hardness, grain type, and depth of each distinct layer were also recorded.

""	Study Site Preparation At the Game Ridge study site, groups of three Pinus ponderosa saplings within two meters of each other were identified, logged and mapped. These tree groupings were used to identify potential study plot sites. Sites were selected, numbered, and assigned treatments randomly by sorting potential plots into larger blocks, and then by selection through individual plot numbers. Treatments were either Ambient or Drought. Tree height and diameter at breast height was measured for each study tree. Plot boundaries were determined and any additional trees within the plot boundaries were cut down at ground height. All plots were trenched to 40 cm at the perimeter. Plot size was on average approximately 7 meters long by 7 meters wide. Within each plot, Pinus ponderosa saplings were randomly assigned a manipulation: Control, Response, or Manipulated. The manipulated tree was designated Shade in 2022 or Girdle in 2023. Treatment Set-Up Electrical metal conduit pipe (EMT conduit) was used to construct a durable frame covered by greenhouse plastic completely covering each ‘Drought’ designated plot. The plastic was held by the frame at an angle to shed rainwater, with an apex at one to 1.5 meters high. Study trees were accommodated with long slits in the plastic that were taped closed around each bole. In December of 2021 Tyvec plastic was installed on the ground around all future 2022 drought plots. Between April 3rd and April 19th 2022 the drought shelter frames were installed and the plastic was deployed on May 9th and 10th for all Control Drought and Shade Drought plots. They were removed on September 24th 2022. Drought shelters were set up and maintained in 2023 from June 2nd through September 26 for all Control Drought and Girdle Drought plots. Single Tree Manipulation Ten total plots were designated for the Shade manipulation in 2022 and ten total plots were designated for the Girdle manipulation in 2023. Ten plots were designated as either ambient or drought controls, with no manipulation treatment. Manipulation Set-Up 2022 The ‘Shade’ manipulation consisted of an EMT conduit frame with a pvc plastic tube arched cap surrounding the manipulated tree, and covered in a shade cloth. Bulk rolls of light grey, 87% black-out shade nets were used to sew covers to completely envelope the canopy of the manipulated tree. The shade manipulation began with net installation July 25-27 2022 and ended on October 12, 2022. Manipulation Set-Up 2023 The ten designated Girdle trees were girdled at 50 cm from the ground on June 2nd, 2023.

""	Study Site Preparation At the Game Ridge study site, groups of three Pinus ponderosa saplings within two meters of each other were identified, logged and mapped. These tree groupings were used to identify potential study plot sites. Sites were selected, numbered, and assigned treatments randomly by sorting potential plots into larger blocks, and then by selection through individual plot numbers. Treatments were either Ambient or Drought. Tree height and diameter at breast height was measured for each study tree. Plot boundaries were determined and any additional trees within the plot boundaries were cut down at ground height. All plots were trenched to 40 cm at the perimeter. Plot size was on average approximately 7 meters long by 7 meters wide. Within each plot, Pinus ponderosa saplings were randomly given a tree assignment: Control, Response, or Manipulated. The manipulated tree was designated Shade in 2022 or Girdle in 2023. The control tree was isolated within the plot from the response tree and manipulated tree by a 20 cm deep trench spanning the plot to remove possible root or fungal interconnections between trees below ground.

Manipulation Set-Up 2023 The ten designated Girdle trees were girdled at 50 cm from the ground on June 2nd, 2023. Physiology Data Collection for Shade Manipulation Trees (2022 and 2023) Sampling occurred from July 21st, 2022, one week ahead of the drought treatment and shade manipulation and continued weekly beginning one week from the start of drought and shading, and lasting through week eight, September 21st, 2022. Only leaves produced in the 2020 growing season were sampled for physiology data. Follow-up sampling of shaded trees in 2023 occurred monthly from June through September (four total sampling dates). Leaf samples taken in 2023 were all from 2023 and consisted of the leaf bud in June and July, followed by individual 2023 needles in August and September. All sample collection occurred pre-dawn, with phloem, xylem, and needle samples secured in aluminum foil packets and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately for NSC and osmotic measurements. Branch tips with needles intact were also returned to the lab for leaf relative water content measurements. Leaf Water Potential. Water potential was measured in individual needles using a pressure chamber (PMS Instrument Company, Corvallis, OR) following methods in Kaufmann (1968). Measurements were taken during pre-dawn sampling. Leaf Relative Water Content. We measured relative water content (RWC) in needles of each sapling based on fresh, saturated, and dry weights as: ((Fresh weight-Dry weight)/(Saturated weight-Dry weight))*100 (Barrs & Weatherley, 1962). Saturated weight was obtained by rehydrating needles for 5 hours in the dark at low temperatures (3 degrees C) following the same methods as Sapes et al. (2021a). Low temperatures prevent oversaturation artifacts that arise due to artificially low osmotic potential resulting from catabolic conversion of starch into sugars (Boyer et al., 2008). Non-structural Carbohydrates. We analyzed NSC in stem xylem and phloem and in needles produced in 2020. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then dried after pre-dawn collection.We used terminal branches for stem and needle samples. We followed the protocols detailed in Sapes et al. (2021a). In short, frozen samples are oven-dried at 70 deg C, and finely ground into a homogenous powder. NSC, starch, and soluble sugars will be measured by the enzymatic method. Leaf and Branch Osmotics. 2020 leaf and twig samples taken during pre-dawn collection as described above, were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Leaves were stored at -50 degrees C until measured in the lab within 3 hours. In the lab, we followed the methods of Grange (1983) to obtain sample extracts. Filter paper disks with sample extract were placed in C-52 osmometers attached to a Psypro data logger (EliTech, Inc., USA) to measure osmotic potential. References Barrs HD, Weatherley PE. 1962.

Data were collected from October 1, 2021 to August 16, 2022 using iButton Link DS1926-F5# Thermochron miniature temperature sensors (https://www.ibuttonlink.com/products/ds1921g) and Tinytag TGP-4017 internal sensors (https://www.micronmeters.com/product/tgp-4017-internal-sensor-40-to-85-c-40-f-to-185-f) deployed across the Kougarok and Teller sites. These sensors are a cost-efficient way to collect snowpack temperatures at a higher spatial resolution than what is normally achieved. iButton data were collected every 4 hours beginning on October 1, 2021. Tinytag data collection began between October 9 and October 12, 2021 depending on sensor installation date. Tinytag data were collected every 30 minutes. In total, data were collected from 236 iButtons and 30 Tinytags. This dataset contains four *.csv files of near-ground surface temperatures at various locations throughout each study site and four *.shp files of sensor locations. Data were collected throughout the snow cover season so that snowpack characteristics could be derived using the temperature data. Sensors were placed both inside and outside of vegetation to better capture the spatial variability of snow properties across each domain. The Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments: Arctic (NGEE Arctic), a research effort to reduce uncertainty in Earth System Models by developing a predictive understanding of carbon-rich Arctic ecosystems and feedbacks to climate. NGEE Arctic was supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska. Through observations, experiments, and synthesis with existing datasets, NGEE Arctic provided an enhanced knowledge base for multi-scale modeling and contributed to improved process representation at global pan-Arctic scales within the Department of Energy's Earth system Model (the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, or E3SM), and specifically within the E3SM Land Model component (ELM).	Seward Peninsula, Alaska	Temperature Sensor Locations: Temperature sensors were placed in clusters throughout each study site. Locations were selected based on vegetation and topographical characteristics to collect measurements of snowpack temperatures under varying conditions. Temperature Data Collection: See Appendix Figure 1 inNGA294 2019-2020 iButton Data User Guide.pdf for temperature sensor locations at each site during the 2021-2022 winter. Ground surface temperature data were collected using DS1921G Thermochron iButtons and Tinytag TGP-4017 internal sensors, both of which are low cost, miniature temperature sensors suited for moderately long logging rates. The iButtons (figure 1) have a temperature range of -40°C to +85°C with an accuracy of ±1°C in the range of -30°C to +70°C and a thermal resolution of 0.5°C. Prior to deployment, iButton sensors were synced to Mountain Daylight Time (MDT) and programmed to record temperatures at 240 minute (4 hour) intervals starting on October 1, 2021. A maximum of 2048 temperatures can be logged and stored on each sensor. iButtons are not waterproof, so each sensor was vacuum sealed in a plastic bag to provide extra protection from moisture before being deployed in the field. Tinytags (Figure 2) are waterproof and have a temperature range of -40°C to +85°C. Throughout this temperature range, Tinytag measurement uncertainty stays below ±1°C. The Tinytag measurements are most accurate when temperatures are in the 20°C - 30°C range, at which point the measurement uncertainty falls just below ±0.5°C. These sensors have a thermal resolution of 0.01°C. Prior to deployment, Tinytag sensors were synced to Mountain Daylight Time (MDT) and programmed to record temperatures at 30 minute intervals. A maximum of 32,000 temperatures can be logged and stored on each sensor. iButtons and Tinytags were then placed throughout the watershed so that temperatures were collected across different ecosystem types.

This study aimed to understand how structural permafrost loss is affecting meter-scale ground elevation. As ice thaws, heaving and slumping of the landscape creates new microtopographical features on the landscape that may alter surface hydrology and soil moisture and thus plant community composition and biogeochemical cycling. The Teller 27 field site is underlain with discontinuous permafrost, so the landscape features a variety of permafrost features. We collected ground elevations from eight subsidence areas in two forms: 1) Transects were sampled laterally through areas of ground subsidence to capture the high edges and low spots where the earth slumped. 2) The circumference of the subsidence area was sampled in order to measure the ground area affected by subsidence. These data were collected with an Emlid Reach RS2 dGPS and a base station. This dataset includes one *.csv of dGPS locations of the eight subsidence locations and one *.kml of measurement locations.

These location IDs begin with “transect”. 2) The circumference of the subsidence area was sampled in order to measure the ground area affected by subsidence. These location IDs begin with “dep”, short for depression. These measurements were collected in areas of visually-identifiable subsidence and are only a sub-sampling of the subsidence occurring at the Teller 27 field site. A total of 146 measurements were collected for eight locations. Co-located ground surface temperature sensor IDs are listed in the Subsidence_Measurements_TL27_2021.csv.

doi:10.15485/2350836	ess-dive-dc8bb081b53f013-20240516T144414805	Metaanalysis of liana and tree functional traits	biosphere|earth science|ecosystems|forests|leaf characteristics|liana functional traits|nitrogen|p50|phosphorus|plant characteristics|sapwood hydraulic conductivity|slope of the plc curve|terrestrial ecosystems|tree functional traits|tropical rainforest|vegetation	The objectives of this project were (i) to determine how tropical trees and lianas differed in terms of their functional traits, and (ii) to parameterize a computational model of tree-liana competition. We carried out a meta-analysis of tree and liana functional traits in order to achieve these goals. First, we downloaded functional trait data from the TRY database during November and December 2019. Traits of interest included leaf, wood, and root functional traits. We included only angiosperm tree and liana species that are found in tropical biomes. We then computed the species average for each trait. The results are included in “TRY_traits_metaanalysis.csv”. We also conducted a second meta-analysis focused on the hydraulic traits of tropical trees and lianas. We used Google Scholar and Web of Science to identify papers that contained hydraulic trait values. The papers that we found were all published between 1997-2019. As with our TRY-based meta-analysis, we included only angiosperm tree and liana species that are found in the tropics, and we computed species averages. The results are contained in the file “hydraulic_traits_metaanalysis.csv”. Both files are in csv format, so they can be read with any plain text editor, as well as programs like R or Excel.	""	The methods employed in generating this data set can be found in the following publication: Willson, A., C. Smith-Martin, A. Trugman, J.S. Powers, and D. Medvigy. Climate and hydraulic traits interact to set thresholds for liana viability. Nature Communications, 13:3332, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-30993-2. The following steps provide a summary of our procedure. TRY meta-analysis: 1) Within the TRY database, we identified traits that had observations for at least 4 tree and liana species. 2) For each trait, we downloaded the dataset for all species available globally and averaged the observations of the trait to the species level to avoid statistical biases introduced in our growth form comparison due to a high density of observations in a few commercially valuable species. 3) We matched the species ID number with the most frequently used growth form identifier using the TRY “growth form” trait and kept the species with the most frequent identifier of “tree,” “liana,” or “woody vine.” We subsetted the data to keep only species with a majority of observations ascribed to the tree and liana growth forms (i.e., no herbaceous species, ferns, etc.), resulting in observations for 44,222 total species. 4) We filtered the dataset of 44,222 species by hand to remove species misclassified as trees or lianas; species occurring entirely in temperate to boreal biomes; species from all gymnosperm lineages except the order Gnetales; and entries for taxonomic classifications broader than the genus level (e.g., taxonomic families). Hydaulic traits meta-analysis: 1) We conducted a literature search using Web of Science and Google Scholar. We searched the following phrases in combination with “liana:” “hydraulic conductivity,” “hydraulic trait,” “hydraulic efficiency,” and “hydraulic K.” 2) Of the literature we found, we kept only the studies that met the following criteria: (a) reported Ks,max measurements for lianas, (b) measured Ks,max instead of computing Ks,max from xylem conduit dimensions, (c) measured Ks,max on sunlit, terminal branches of mature individuals or saplings, and (d) measured Ks,max on a branch longer than the longest vessel. We considered the authors to have used a branch length longer than maximum vessel length if the authors measured or reported maximum vessel length for the species and a longer branch was used. 3) Because the best methodological practice for measuring P50, especially in species with long vessels, is currently a matter of debate, we additionally removed all observations of P50 > 0.75. This filtering was performed to reduce the probability that falsely high (i.e., less negative) P50 values were retained in our analysis because of improper measurement technique.

This study site was chosen due to its unique fire history, as the Kougarok Fire Complex has experienced multiple wildfires since 1971. As the Arctic warms, the risk of Arctic tundra fires continues to increase due to warmer summer temperatures and higher frequency of lightning. Burned soil carbon or pyrogenic carbon (PyC) is an important component of C cycling after wildfire, and one that is often overlooked in tundra systems where wildfires are historically rare. To better understand PyC signatures and quantify PyC presence in post-regeneration permafrost regions, soils were sampled from soil pits within the 1971, 2002, and 2019 burn sites, as well as two unburned control sites. At each site, three soil pits were dug to the permafrost table. Soil samples were collected with a trowel from the face of each pit at 10 cm increments down to the permafrost table. Thaw depth, maximum vegetation height, vegetation species composition, and O horizon depth were also collected at each soil pit. An HS2 Hydrosense II Handheld Soil Moisture Sensor was used to collect volumetric soil moisture content at each 10 cm sampling increment. This dataset includes one *.csv of middle infrared spectroscopy measurements of soil samples, one *.csv of field observations, one *.csv of carbon and nitrogen analysis of soil samples, and one *.kml of sampling locations.

At each site, three soil pits were dug to the permafrost table. Soil samples were collected with a trowel from the face of each pit at 10 cm increments down to the permafrost table. Thaw depth, maximum vegetation height, vegetation species composition, and O horizon depth were also collected at each soil pit (Figure 2). An HS2 Hydrosense II Handheld Soil Moisture Sensor was used to collect volumetric soil moisture content at each 10 cm sampling increment. Laboratory Processing and Analysis: In the lab, soils were air-dried and sieved to 2 mm. Finely ground soil samples between 0 cm and 30 cm depth were analyzed in duplicate for total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations using an Elemental Analyzer (Thermo Scientific Flash 2000, Waltham, MA, USA) using an aspartic acid standard and both aspartic acid and certified soil reference material as check standards. All duplicates had a replicate error of <15% or soils were re-analyzed. To calculate soil organic C stocks in bulk soils, soil sample collection depths, soil bulk density data collected nearby were used from Hollingsworth et al. (2020) and Thaler et al (in prep), and organic C data. FT-IR Sample Processing: Finely ground subsamples from 0 cm to 30 cm were scanned on a Fourier Transformed-Middle Infrared (FT-IR) Spectrometer (Bruker Alpha II, Billerica, MA, USA) in the infrared range from 4050 to 550 cm-1. Samples were run in quadruplicate where each replicate is an average of 64 co-scans per spectrum with a resolution of 4 cm-1 and calibrated against a reference scan. When analyzing or modeling FT-IR data, reflectance is converted to absorbance so that soil chemical components are linearly related to spectral wavelengths (Gobrecht et al., 2015). Bruker OPUS software was used to convert reflectance (R) to absorbance (A) where A = -logR. The raw FT-IR data was processed by first reducing spectral noise. After testing multiple smoothing methods, the Savitzky-Golay filter was applied in the soilspec package (Wadoux et al., 2021) for its ability to retain high resolution peaks in the wavenumber ranges that coincide with SOM Properties. After smoothing, an iterative restricted least squares transformation was applied to the baseline using the baseline package (Figure 2.3; Liland et al., 2023).

Data were collected from October 1, 2021 to August 16, 2022 using iButton Link DS1926-F5# Thermochron miniature temperature sensors (https://www.ibuttonlink.com/products/ds1921g) and Tinytag TGP-4017 internal sensors (https://www.micronmeters.com/product/tgp-4017-internal-sensor-40-to-85-c-40-f-to-185-f) deployed across the Kougarok and Teller sites. These sensors are a cost-efficient way to collect snowpack temperatures at a higher spatial resolution than what is normally achieved. iButton data were collected every 4 hours beginning on October 1, 2021. Tinytag data collection began between October 9, 2021 and October 12, 2021 depending on the specific Tinytag and data were collected every 30 minutes. In total, data were collected from 236 iButtons and 30 Tinytags. This dataset contains four *.csv files of near-ground surface temperatures at various locations throughout each study site and four *.shp files of sensor locations. Data were collected throughout the snow cover season so that snowpack characteristics could be derived using the temperature data. Sensors were placed both inside and outside of vegetation to better capture the spatial variability of snow properties across each domain. The Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments: Arctic (NGEE Arctic), was a 15-year research effort (2012-2027) to reduce uncertainty in Earth System Models by developing a predictive understanding of carbon-rich Arctic ecosystems and feedbacks to climate. NGEE Arctic was supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska. Through observations, experiments, and synthesis with existing datasets, NGEE Arctic provided an enhanced knowledge base for multi-scale modeling and contributed to improved process representation at global pan-Arctic scales within the Department of Energy's Earth system Model (the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, or E3SM), and specifically within the E3SM Land Model component (ELM).	Seward Peninsula, Alaska	Temperature sensors were placed in clusters throughout each study site. Prior to field deployment, locations were selected based on vegetation and topography so that measurements of snowpack temperatures could be collected in areas with a variety of site conditions. Within each cluster, stakes were placed in areas with different vegetation characteristics. At each of these groupings, researchers attempted to place sensors in areas of dense shrubs, less dense shrubs, and directly outside of shrub patches. See the User Guide for more information, images of sensors, and location. Ground surface temperature data were collected using DS1921G Thermochron iButtons and Tinytag TGP-4017 internal sensors, both of which are low cost, miniature temperature sensors suited for moderately long logging rates. The iButtons (figure 1) have a temperature range of -40°C to +85°C with an accuracy of ±1°C in the range of -30°C to +70°C and a thermal resolution of 0.5°C. Prior to deployment, iButton sensors were synced to Mountain Daylight Time (MDT) and programmed to record temperatures at 240 minute (4 hour) intervals starting on October 1, 2021. A maximum of 2048 temperatures can be logged and stored on each sensor. iButtons are not waterproof, so each sensor was vacuum sealed in a plastic bag to provide extra protection from moisture before being deployed in the field. Tinytags (Figure 2) are waterproof and have a temperature range of -40°C to +85°C. Throughout this temperature range, Tinytag measurement uncertainty stays below ±1°C. The Tinytag measurements are most accurate when temperatures are in the 20°C - 30°C range, at which point the measurement uncertainty falls just below ±0.5°C. These sensors have a thermal resolution of 0.01°C. Prior to deployment, Tinytag sensors were synced to Mountain Daylight Time (MDT) and programmed to record temperatures at 30 minute intervals. A maximum of 32,000 temperatures can be logged and stored on each sensor. iButtons and Tinytags were then placed throughout the watershed so that temperatures were collected across different ecosystem types.

Measurements were made using a PP-Systems UniSpec-DC spectrometer mounted on an automatically operated instrument cart. Spectra were collected at 137 stop points at 0.5 m intervals along the tram transect. Transect runs were collected daily, or multiple times per day, from April or May through to August or September each year. Downwelling radiance was measured using a 2 meter fiber optic cable connected to a cosine diffuser. Upwelling (i.e. reflected) radiance was measured using a 2 meter cable connected to a 12 degree field-of-view (FOV) lens. Canopy reflectance was calculated using the ratio of upwelling to downwelling radiance measured over a 99.99% reflectance Spectralon standard measured at the start of each measurement set. Unprocessed spectral data are presented in .spu files. Metadata are provided in csv files, and the instrument manual (pdf).

NGEE Arctic Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska	"A PP-Systems UniSpec-DC spectrometer was set up to acquire spectra at each of the tram's 137 stops in addition to a spectralon reference scanned three times at the start of each run. In 2017 and 2018 a reference scan was also added to the end on each run. Reference plates at the start of each run are designated by the stop number ""_000"" in the file name while references at the end of a run are designated by ""_end"". Due to operational issues with the tram, days and times of operation are not always consistent, including some periods where stops were skipped resulting in mismatched reference numbers. While there is no straightforward method for validating data during periods of inconsistency, some information can be inferred from timestamps and it is apparent when operations were proceeding as expected. The .spu files generated are ASCII text files containing 10 header lines followed by 256 rows of tab separated values corresponding to each of the optical channel's wavelength bins and measured values. To convert these to reflectance values, each spectra should be corrected for dark current, the wavelengths should be interpolated to a single set of bins and then ratioed and normalized using the corresponding reference spectra. Preliminary code to accomplish this is presented in this repository https://github.com/TESTgroup-BNL/UniSpec_Processing/, with the 2018_Improvements branch being the most complete."

This data on stem growth patterns will eventually be integrated with other ongoing data streams to paint a broader picture of plant phenology. This data package contains the outputs from three types of dendrometer devices: ICT band dendrometer data is in the ""ICT_data2020_2023.csv"" file, TreeHugger band dendrometer data is in the ""TreeHugger_data2019_2020.csv"" file, and TOMST point dendrometer data is in the ""TOMST_data2021_2023.csv"" file. The TreeHugger and TOMST files contain corrected and raw uncorrected values, whereas the ICT data file contains only raw data. Initial tree size data at device installation is located in the ""Initial_Tree_Size.csv"" file. Additional information on units are contained within each data file's respective data dictionary, and the location metadata file contains the geographic locations of the 23 forestry plots at The Morton Arboretum as well as the measured tree species at each location."	Dendrometer data was collected on four to five trees within the Forestry Plots at The Morton Arboretum. See the Locations_metadata file for geographic coordinates of each forestry plot.	"Dendrometers were installed at DBH (1.3 m aboveground) to measure changes in circumference (ICT and TreeHugger bands) and radial growth (TOMST point dendrometers) of four to five trees in each of the established forestry plots. TreeHuggers were the first to be installed in March/April of 2019 (set to 15 minute measurement increments then adjusted to 60 minute increments in 2020 to increase battery lifespan). As additional forestry plots were added or as TreeHuggers required replacement, TOMST point dendrometers were installed in 2021 to collect measurements in 15 minute increments. The ICT dendrometers were installed in 2020 in only four of the plots and collect measurements in 30 minute increments. ICT bands measure changes in stem circumference in mm, TreeHuggers measure changes in stem circumference in mm, and TOMST measure radial growth in um. After data for each dendrometer was downloaded, the files for TreeHugger and TOMST devices were appended, corrected, and hourly averages were calculated using Python. For each specific group (""Series"" column and year), a standardized Z-score was calculated to identify outliers (Z-score = value - (mean(value)/stdev(value)). Values with a Z-score beyond +/- 2 standard deviations are considered outliers and were replaced or marked as NA's in the corrected value column. Using R Studio, datetime issues (typically for TreeHuggers) were manually corrected based on the date of installation and the last download for each device. Data for TreeHuggers and TOMST were then split into individual files, and ICT data for each device was also appended into its own file. Missing value codes are added as ""-99999""."

NGEE Arctic Teller Site, Mile Marker 27, Alaska	"Leaf area index (LAI) was measured under sunny, clear sky conditions using a LAI-2200C (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). The measurements were collected using one LAI-2200 wand and console, with a 45° restrictor cap installed. Before measurement, a ""4"" sequence was collected to enabled scatter correction during data processing. This sequence consists of a measurement with the diffuser cap installed in full sun, a measurement with the diffuser cap installed in full shade, a measurement with no restrictor cap installed in full sun, and a measurement with the 45° restrictor cap installed in full sun. This process was repeated every 10 sample locations. We collected one ""above"" and multiple ""below"" (>4) LAI measurements at each sampled location, with the 45° view angle of the sensor perpendicular to the sun. In regions with low-stature plants, 5 ""below"" LAI measurements were collected at the center and four corners of a 4 x 4 m square. At locations with tall shrubs, multiple LAI measurements were collected under the targeted shrub patch. Values reported are an average of the readings for each location. LAI values were computed using the software application FV2200 v 2.2.1 (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). Readings were first scatter corrected by applying the ""4A"" sequence taken at the start of every tenth location. Then a mask was applied to remove the outer ring from the integrated LAI measurement. Finally, LAI was calculated by comparing each of the ""below"" readings for a given location with the ""above"" reading for that location. The GPS coordinates for each of the sample locations was measured using a portable Trimble Geo7X differential GPS connected to a Zephyr Model 2 Dual Frequency GNSS antenna (Trimble Incorporated, Sunnyvale, California, USA). At each location, we logged a point measurement every second for at least 1 minute. We post-processed the location using the nearest available base-station data from the Trimble Reference Network. At sampled locations with low stature vegetation the GPS location was recorded in the center of the sampled grid. In locations with tall, dense shrubs the GPS location was recorded on the edge of the region of the shrub patch. The region of interest (either plot or shrub patch) for each LAI measurement was manually identified based on dGPS location, field notes, and high resolution UAS imagery. The region of interest identifier that corresponds to the LAI sample identifier is included in the attribute of each polygon."

Seward Peninsula, Alaska	Leaf gas exchange measurements were made in situ on 51 fully expanded, attached leaves of Salix pulchra, Alnus viridis, and Salix glauca using two LI-COR LI-6800 gas exchange systems. Samples were measured in situ on plants located within 1km of the road at the NGEE Arctic Teller (Mile Marker 27) and Kougarok (Mile Marker 64) sites on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska. Following enclosure of the sample in the cuvette, the leaf was allowed to stabilize to cuvette conditions. Stomatal response at light levels of 1500, 500, 200, 75 and 0 micromol/m2/s was measured while controlling for sample CO2 concentration, leaf to air vapor pressure deficit, and keeping leaf temperature near to ambient temperatures. Leaves were acclimated to each light level for a minimum of 30 minutes, or until conductance was stable. Following completion of each curve, the leaf sample was removed from the chamber and the leaf area was measured. In cases where the leaf did not fill the leaf chamber aperture, results were recalculated to adjust for leaf area. A flatbed scanner and image processing software (ImageJ v 1.53) were used to estimate leaf area. The files included in this data package follow the ESS-DIVE Leaf-level gas exchange data and metadata reporting format (doi:10.15485/1659484).

To conduct controlled rainfall experiments at remote field sites in the Arctic, the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments Arctic Rainfall Simulator (NARS) was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory as part of the NGEE Arctic project. To better understand how rainfall may affect interflow biogeochemistry and permafrost thaw, rainfall simulations were performed on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska during late September and early October 2022 at the Kougarok Fire Site near mile marker 86 of the Nome-Taylor Highway. Water samples were collected before, during, and after rainfall simulations until interflow had ceased. Additional data collected included soil pore water samples from macrorhizons, active layer depths, and volumetric water content at each of the experimental plots. This dataset contains one *.csv file of water sample properties, one *.csv file of thaw depths, one *.csv file of soil moisture measurements, and one *.kml file of the locations where samples were collected.

Kougarok Fire Site: Also known as the Kougarok Fire Complex. This study site is located near mile marker 86 of the Nome-Taylor Highway (Kougarok Rd) on the Seward Peninsula, AK. The site has experienced multiple fires over the last 50 years.	Rainfall simulations were performed at the Kougarok Fire Site at mile marker 86 from September 2022 to October 2022, and the data was processed in a laboratory in 2023. The rainfall simulator design is detailed in a recent publication, Renner et al., 2024. From a tank next to each plot, water was pumped through a hose and delivered to the plot through solenoids. As the water is delivered to the plot, the soil becomes saturated and interflow travels through a flume at the lower end of the plot. In fall of 2022, two rainfall simulations were conducted, one with short duration and high intensity (40 min, 80 mm/hr) and one with long duration and low intensity (160 min, 20 mm/hr). Water was collected before, during, and after the simulations to be analyzed for major anions, major cations, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Interflow Water Samples Water samples were collected before, during, and after rainfall simulations until interflow had ceased. Interflow was defined as water travelling laterally through the plot after infiltrating the soil or being flushed out of the ground by the saturation of the active layer. Samples of the water used in each simulation were also collected to understand the initial properties of the input waters before they were applied to the experimental plots. These water samples were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total organic carbon (TOC), inorganic carbon, anions, and major cations in a laboratory setting. Macrorhizon Water Samples Macrorhizons were used to collect soil pore water samples before and after simulations to understand initial and post-simulation conditions. After field work, these water samples were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total organic carbon (TOC), inorganic carbon, anions, and major cations in a laboratory setting. Volumetric Water Content with Hydrosense II probe Volumetric water content data were collected using a Hydrosense II soil-water sensor and data logger, which collected the GPS location of the moisture samples. The Hydrosense sensor relies on soil dielectric properties to estimate volumetric water content (VWC). A total of ten moisture measurements were taken inside each plot after a simulation. Measurements were also taken outside of each plot for comparison. The VWC values in this dataset have not been calibrated. Thaw Depth Measurement Thaw depths were collected using a frost probe at least 5 times within each plot. Some measurements were also taken at nearby locations earlier in the year during late June or early July. These are included in the thaw depth .csv.

These sensors are a cost-efficient way to collect snowpack temperatures at a higher spatial resolution than what is normally achieved. iButton data were collected every 3 hours from a total of 19 iButtons. iButtons were placed in pairs, with one iButton placed at the ground surface and another buried 1 - 5 cm below the ground surface. One buried iButton did not successfully collect data, and therefore was excluded from this dataset. Data were collected throughout the snow cover season so that snowpack characteristics could be derived using the temperature data. Specifically, this dataset was used as a validation source for a novel machine learning approach to estimating snow depth (see related publication). Sensors were placed in areas with bare ground or minimal grass coverage, located away from any large vegetation. At Site A (TA51), manual snow depths were collected as validation data. These measurements were taken next to iButtons periodically throughout the winter, and notes on other precipitation types were also recorded. At Site B (TA6 Meteorological Station), a nearby sensor collected snow depths throughout the winter. This dataset contains one *.csv file of snow/ground interface temperatures at two sites, one *.csv file of manually collected snow depths, and one *.kml file of sensor locations.

Each pair included an iButton on the ground surface (or snow-ground interface) and an iButton buried in soil about 5 cm beneath the ground surface. iButton pairings are noted in the .csv of temperature measurements. At Site A, manual snow depth measurements were collected periodically throughout the winter using a thaw probe and a tape measure. Between 1 and 6 snow depth measurements were collected each time at flagged locations along a 3 meter long transect. When possible, multiple measurements were taken so that snow depth measurements can account for the impacts of minor variations in topography, drifting, and solar radiation at this study site. At Site B, pairs of iButtons were installed around a pre-existing snow depth sensor so that future work with this data can be validated (see Figure 2 in User Guide .pdf file).

At each site, 5 replicate blocks were established in disturbed and intact upland tussock tundra (a total of 40 plots). Disturbed plots at Council were located on thermo-erosional (thermokarst) slopes, while disturbed plots in Quartz Creek were in burned areas affected by the Mingvk Lake fire in 2015. Using a split-plot design, an additional manual disturbance treatment (scraping to remove the surface bryophyte layer) was implemented across all blocks in June 2018. Seeds of five erect, deciduous shrubs were broadcast seeded into each plot in June 2018, and seedlings were censused in August 2018 and August 2019. The dataset includes ancillary measurements of plot-level environmental conditions (soil temperature, moisture, chemistry, thaw depth, microtopography, substrate thickness) and vegetation composition (NDVI and estimated percent cover by species and plant functional type). Dataset contains 10 csv data files (five data files with corresponding data dictionaries and one file-level metadata file) and one pdf user guide. The Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments: Arctic (NGEE Arctic), was research effort to reduce uncertainty in Earth System Models by developing a predictive understanding of carbon-rich Arctic ecosystems and feedbacks to climate. NGEE Arctic was supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska. Through observations, experiments, and synthesis with existing datasets, NGEE Arctic provided an enhanced knowledge base for multi-scale modeling and contributed to improved process representation at global pan-Arctic scales within the Department of Energy's Earth system Model (the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, or E3SM), and specifically within the E3SM Land Model component (ELM).	Seward Peninsula, Alaska	Seed Addition Experiment In the beginning of the 2018 growing season, a manipulative experiment was established to examine the process by which landscape disturbance influences shrub seedling recruitment and establishment. The experiment utilized a factorial design to compare two site-level disturbance treatments with reference undisturbed sites. The disturbance treatment was combined with a split-plot scraping treatment (scraped, unscraped) with 5 replicate blocks per disturbance treatment. Each replicate block consisted of pair of 0.75 x 1.5m plots separated by less than 2m. Seeds of five shrub species from sites throughout the Seward Peninsula were collected in October 2017 and cold stratified them at -20°C for 8 months. In June 2018, each plot was broadcast seeded with 100 seeds each of Alnus viridis subsp. fruticosa, Betula glandulosa, B. nana, and 50 seeds of Salix pulchra and S. glauca. To determine the effect of seed bed preparation by disturbance upon seedling establishment, one plot from each pair was scraped to remove bryophytes (mosses and lichens) in a surface manipulation treatment prior to seeding. This treatment mimics the substrate modifications and increased access to mineral soil that occurs as a result of disturbance events (via combustion during fire or subsidence during thermokarst). This form of novel disturbance was done using a hand cultivator in accordance with the protocol utilized by the Global Treeline Experiment (Brown et al. 2013). All removed material was collected, dried, and weighed for biomass quantification. Each plot was divided into 50 subplots (15 x 15cm) and seed was sown 16 randomly selected subplots at a rate of 25 seeds per subplot. The subplot method was chosen to ensure efficacy of seedling census efforts by restricting search area and to isolate seeds by species (since germinants of the same family can be difficult to identify at species-level prior to development of true leaves). Seedling Recruitment and Establishment After sowing seeds in June 2018, population-level censuses were conducted at the end of the first growing season (August 2018) and second growing season (August 2019). During each census seedling abundance and mortality were recorded. Delayed germination of seedlings was observed during surveys at the beginning of the second growing season (June 2019). As a result, seedling abundance counts in August 2019 include both seedlings that germinated during the first season in addition to those which emerged during the second season. Microsite Bioclimatic Characteristics Within each plot multiple abiotic and biotic parameters were measured to characterize environmental conditions controlling seedling success. In order to characterize microsite variability, each of these parameters were measured in three subplots per plot, with each of the parameter measurements co-located. Thaw depth was determined by manually inserting a 92 cm long metal tile probe into the soil and measuring the depth of insertion from the top of the moss layer to the frost layer. A value the length of the tile probe (Flag V2) indicates that the probe was fully inserted and did not reach the permafrost table. Soil temperature was monitored during each sample period. In 2018 the measurements were made at a 20 cm depth from the surface horizon using a Traceable® long-stem digital thermometer, while in 2019 they were located at a 15 cm depth using an Aquatuff 35200-K thermocouple. In 2019, soil volumetric water content for the top 0-20 cm of the soil profile was measured using Time Domain Reflectometry with a MiniTrase TDR (Soilmoisture Equipment Corp.). Seedbed substrate thickness (the distance between the top surface of the moss or lichen layer to the Oi soil horizon) was measured. Plot micro-scale topography (the depth from vegetative surface to the seedbed substrate) was also quantified. Vascular and non-vascular absolute percent cover by plant functional type (erect dwarf shrub, deciduous prostrate shrub, evergreen prostrate shrub, graminoid, forb, live moss, lichen, liverwort) and as well as substrate (bare, dead moss, litter) was quantified in each plot. At Quartz Creek vascular and non-vascular absolute percent cover by species was also quantified. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI = (NIR-Red)/(NIR+Red)) was quantified at each plot in August 2019 using a portable SpectroSense2 (Skye Instruments). Lastly, canopy height (the maximum height of vegetation within each plot) was measured in August 2018. Soil Biogeochemistry Two sets of soil cores were collected for laboratory analysis from locations adjacent to each plot (note that since these cores were collected outside of plot boundaries, they were not subject to the manual disturbance scraping treatment). In August 2018, cores were collected from the organic horizon surface to a depth of 10 cm (the rooting zone substrate) using a sharpened 2.5 cm diameter core liner. In June 2019, cores were collected from the entirety of the thawed soil and the depth of sample was noted. These samples were extracted using a 2.5 cm diameter AMS soil corer and the sample was transferred to a sealed plastic bag. All cores were frozen after collection and stored at -20°C until processing. In the laboratory, air-dry samples were oven-dried at 60°C for 48 hours, ground using a mortar and pestle, and sieved in preparation for analysis. After sample preparation, carbon and nitrogen composition (% total C and % total N) was measured using a Costech ECS 410 elemental analyzer. Soil organic matter concentration was quantified through loss on ignition via combustion in a 550°C furnace. Soil pH was measured for the 10 cm depth soils only using a weight-based 7:1 deionized water to soil ratio in order to account for the large organic component of these samples. Additionally, soil bulk density was quantified for each core sample.

This data package includes streamflow measurements collected using low-visibility and low-impact installations at four sites on the Tuolumne River in Yosemite National Park, for water years 2002 to 2021. The resulting data set offers a unique opportunity to explore hydrologic processes in complex terrain. This data package contains half-hourly recordings of unvented pressure, vented pressure, and water temperature are measured and used to estimate discharge and stage height. Discharge flags provide insight into data anomalies. This dataset is formatted in accordance with ESS-Dive's Hydrologic Monitoring and File Level Metadata Formats. It contains the following files: 1) Folder containing four csv files of time series streamflow measurements (unvented pressure, vented pressure, estimated discharge, water temperature, stage height, and discharge flag) from four locations on the Tuolumne River 2) Data dictionary (dd.csv) containing units, definitions, human readable column names, and data type for all column headers throughout the dataset 3) File-level metadata (FLMD.csv) containing metadata for files contained in the dataset 4) Installation methods (InstallationMethods.csv) containing metadata on sensor installation	Tuolumne@120, Tuolumne 120, Tuolumne River where it passes under Highway 120	Rating Curves: The rating curve equation used to determine discharge is: for H < 0.8011m, Q = 34.3522*(H-0.7639)^1.465 for H > 0.8011m, Q = 17.0873(H-0.7076)^1.7401 Note: The greatest uncertainties occur at very high flows (due to the small number of manual measurements in that range) and at very low flows (due to uncertainty in the gauge datum and the exact water depth above the sensor when discharge stops). Data Postprocessing and Quality Control Summary: This file includes raw, corrected, and estimated data. The 'sensor_pressure_unvented(cm)' data is a temporally-continuous record made up of a number of different loggers deployed through time (generally changed once per summer). The corrected data includes both the 'sensor_pressure_vented(cm)' and 'adjusted_stage(cm)' time series, which apply an atmospheric pressure correction and datum correction, respectively. The 'estimated_discharge(cms)' time series is an estimate of discharge computed using the 'adjusted_stage(cm)' time series and site rating curve (which is built using manual measurements collected over several summers). The postprocessing includes all the of steps needed to translate the 'sensor_pressure_unvented(cm)' time series into the 'estimated_discharge(cms)' time series. There is a summary of the steps below. For a comprehensive, thorough view of the post processing, visit the following url, where all steps are documented in Jupyter notebooks: https://github.com/Mountain-Hydrology-Research-Group/tum_hydro_postprocessing_2022 For each site, the following operations were completed: 1. Both vented and unvented Levelogger time series were inspected, trimmed (to the segment when the sensor was actively deployed), converted to appropriate units, and examined for sensor malfunctions, ice jams, and sensor shifts. 2. A barometric pressure correction was applied to the unvented Levelogger time series using colocated Barologger time series when available and NCAR Reanalysis surface pressure data otherwise. When NCAR Reanalysis data was used, a hypsometric elevation correction was applied before performing the barometric correction. 3. An offset was applied to both vented and barometrically corrected unvented Levelogger time series to convert to the stage reference datum. Offsets are typically estimated by comparing the 'sensor_pressure_vented(cm)' to previous corrected time series and/or available manual stage measurements. 4. For each water year, either the vented or corrected unvented Levelogger time series was selected (based on data availability and quality) as the stage measurement ('adjusted_stage(cm)') 5. Stage time series from consecutive years were concatenated 6. Discharge was estimated using the stage time series and documented rating curve. See Lundquist, J.D., et al. (2016) in related references for detailed methods.

Modeling these emissions is challenging due to the temporal and spatial variability in wetland structure and CH4 flux rates, along with complex interactions among hydrological, ecological, meteorological, and microbial processes that govern CH4 dynamics. To address these issues, we aim to enhance the accuracy of wetland representation in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model, ELM. This effort led to the development of ELM-Wet, which incorporates a dedicated wetland landunit with subgrid representation of eco-hydrological patch types. We implement wetland-specific hydrology by imposing site-specific constraints on surface water levels, thereby allowing different patches to sustain varying depths of inundation. Additionally, we refined the calculation of aerenchyma transport diffusivity based on observed conductance across different vegetation types. We validated these enhancements through site-specific simulations of a coastal freshwater wetland, the Salvador WMA Freshwater Marsh (Ameriflux, site ID US-LA2), located in the coast of Louisiana (29.85N,90.29W) at an elevation of 0 m. The site was simulated with ELM-Wet and the default version ELMv1. We use Bayesian Optimization to parameterize CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Eddy covariance observations of CO2 and CH4 fluxes from 2012-2013 were used to train the model and data from 2021 were used for validation. In this repository, we include all the output of all the simulations performed using different versions of ELMv1 and ELM-Wet, all input required to the model, and the Matlab scripts we used to processed the output data. ELM-Wet_flmd.csv includes a detailed description of the datasets files.	Salvador WMA Freshwater Marsh (Ameriflux, site ID US-LA2), located in the coast of Louisiana (29.85N,90.29W) at an elevation of 0 m.	Simulations were run following the procedures outlined in Oleson et al. (2013). Initially, there was a 400-year accelerated spin-up phase aimed at reaching carbon equilibrium through enhanced accumulation processes. This was followed by a subsequent 400-year regular spin-up phase, during which standard decomposition parameters were applied (Yuan et al. 2021). Transient simulations were conducted from 1850 to 2022 using the Global Soil Wetness Project forcing and varying CO2 concentrations over time (Dirmeyer et al. 2006) and (Zhu et al. 2019). Default forcings for GSWP were used where the forcing dataset included humidity, temperature, short wave radiation, precipitation, and atmospheric pressure. Four simulations setups were considered: (1) ELMv1-Dflt – is default “out of the box” ELMv1 without any site-specific parameterization (Zhu et al. 2019). (2) ELMv1: ELMv1 but with parameter optimization (see section 2.4.4) using site-level observations from the site. This simulation set and the following ones (simulation sets 3-4) all optimized the same set of parameters. (3) ELM-Wet: The newly developed version of ELM (ELM-Wet) with its separate wetland landunit. In this simulation we prescribed a maximum inundation depth for each wetland patch type and had the model resolve water depth. All patch-level parameters optimized from observations. (4) ELM-Wet-SiteWTD: Used ELM-Wet forced with observed timeseries of water surface elevation, and parameters optimized from observations. We employed the Bayesian Optimization for Anything (BOA) workflow to parameterize model parameters. BOA, a newly developed software tool, offers a versatile range of Bayesian optimization functions designed to optimize parameters in models written in various programming languages.

Council Hwy Mile 71.5 (CN_MM71)	Power, Communication, and Data Collection (PCDC) Stations (See the user guide for more details.) Anticipating large numbers of instruments and sensors being deployed at Council site in Phase 3, we have designed a centralized communication and data collection system. This system is connected to the internet via radio and satellite links and allows researchers remotely monitor instruments performance and receive observational data in near real-time mode. In June 2018 we deployed two sets of instruments and installed a radio internet connection. One set of instruments run only through the summer and another one is for year-around observations. All communication equipment, data collection components, and instruments is powered by solar and wind energy. The internet connection is provided by a satellite link at the White Mountain, AK airport and then retransmitted via radio communication to the Council field site. We set up a powerful and easily expandable energy module, satellite internet connection, and centralized data collection system. This will allow a more consistent platform for communication with redundancy points and backup communication that can quickly adapt to addition of new instruments. Meteorological Data This dataset is comprised of four comma-separated (*.csv) files of meteorological data from the two PCDC Stations reported at 10- and 30-minute aggregation intervals. Temporal Range Measurements began in June of 2018 for 10-minute data and September 2018 for 30-minute data. New data will be added periodically/annually. Quality Level The quality level of these data is designated as Level 1 -- an internally consistent data product that has been subjected to quality checks and data management procedures including, for example: review of calibrations, diurnal analyses to look for expected patterns, or time series analyses to detect outliers, extreme values, or time periods with too little or too much variation.

The study site is underlain by discontinuous permafrost that is thawing as the climate warms. As a result, the site is experiencing a short-term wetting trend as a perched water table above the remaining permafrost provides plant available water during the growing season. Soil moisture patterns drive microbial activity and plant species compositions including plant density and height. This study aimed to understand how soil moisture patterns were influenced by tundra microtopography. To accomplish this, we placed a strategic network of soil moisture sensors in micro-highs, micro-lows, and control areas under different vegetation types within the Teller 27 watershed from summer of 2022 through fall of 2023. This data was used in conjunction with other soil data from the Teller 27 watershed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of soil moisture patterns in a rapidly thawing discontinuous permafrost region. This dataset includes six *.csv files: four of time series soil moisture data, one of field soil moisture data, and one of site conditions. The dataset also includes one *.kml file of the watershed and the soil moisture sensor sites as well as this user guide to provide details on data collection and processing methods.

NGEE Arctic Teller Site, Mile Marker 27 (TL_MM27), Alaska	The in-situ sensor network at Teller 27 consists of spatial and temporal soil moisture data. We installed soil moisture sensors (10HS Soil Moisture Smart Sensor, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA) throughout the Teller watershed logging (H21-USB, HOBO USB Micro-Station Data Logger, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA) continuously every 30 minutes starting in July of 2022. These sensors measure volumetric water content (VWC) in cm3 water per cm3 of soil (±3% accuracy) with a stated sensor volume of one liter to prevent bias from very fine-scale soil variability. The loggers were strategically placed in permafrost thaw features with high microtopographic heterogeneity which were identified by hydrology analyses from a fine resolution, lidar-derived digital elevation model. We placed four loggers with five sensors each at a depth of approximately 5-10 cm below the soil surface. At each logging station, two sensors were placed in micro-highs, two sensors in micro-lows, and one sensor in a control area of the permafrost feature. Ten of the 20 soil moisture sensors collected data between July 2022 until August 2022 before they were destroyed by wildlife. The remaining ten soil moisture sensors collected data until September 2023 for multi-year, spatially and temporally discrete soil moisture measurements. From the ten soil moisture sensors that remained in the field throughout the winter of 2022, we omitted observations when soils were frozen. We determined freeze and thaw dates by plotting the time series data in Hoboware software and assessing when the VWC rapidly dropped and rose, respectively. From the remaining data, we calculated daily averages and removed any observations with a VWC of less than 0 or greater than 1, which is due to sensor error. During the initial sensor installation, we also collected field data relevant to soil moisture. These data include O horizon depths in cm from seven cores per sensor site, vegetation type according to the Teller 27 hyperspectral vegetation map (SWDT: sedge-willow-Dryas tundra; WS: willow shrub; MSSTT: mixed shrub-sedge tussock tundra; Konduri et al., 2022), the maximum vegetation height in cm, and thaw depths in cm using a thaw probe from five locations around each site. The O horizon depths and thaw depths were averaged to reduce the risk of sampling heterogenous soils. At each sensor location, we collected soil samples and brought them back to the laboratory for field soil moisture analysis. We dried each soil sample in a drying oven first at 65°C for 72 hours and then at 105°C for 22 hours. The field weight minus the dry weight gives the amount of water in the soils under ambient conditions from July 2022.

Additional information on units and other file-level metadata can be found within each data file's respective data dictionary, and metadata for each of the 23 surveyed plots can be found within the ""Location_metadata.csv"" file. While the ""leafRaw.csv"" and the ""leafSmooth.csv"" files contain all data for all species, the ""leafPhenophaseDates2019-2023.csv"" file currently excludes the dates for evergreen species in 2023. Another version of the file will be added as those dates are extracted."	Leaf phenology data was collected within the Forestry Plots at The Morton Arboretum. See the Locations_metadata file for geographic coordinates of each forestry plot.	"Battery-powered trail cameras were installed in 2019 just before the beginning of the growing season and new cameras were added as we established more plots. Cameras were positioned to capture the canopy and species of interest and set to capture six hourly images each day. Cameras were replaced or added as needed, and images were downloaded twice a year when replacing batteries. After naming and organizing images, image analysis was performed on each plot and year using the PhenoCam GUI W64 v1.1 from the PhenoCam Network. Three regions of interest (ROIs) were selected for each batch of images to assess red, green, and blue digital numbers, and to calculate a time-series of the green chromatic coordinate (gcc). The raw and smooth outputs of the PhenoCam GUI can be found within the leafRaw.csv and leafSmooth.csv data files, respectively. For phenophase extraction, data for each plot was normalized within ROIs and averaged across ROIs for each year. Phenophase date extraction for the start, peak, and end of the growing season was performed using the phenofit R package and four combinations of curve-fitting and date extraction. Extracted dates were averaged for each plot and year across the four methods and the results were visually inspected for accuracy. Manual extraction was performed where possible if dates could not be extracted using the package, or if the resulting dates were deemed inaccurate due to noisy data. Plots and/or years with missing data due to camera/battery failure were recorded as ""-9999"". Extracted dates for replicate species plots or replicate cameras for a single plot (e.g., ASTR-E and ASTR-W, or AEGL-E and AEGL-E-FAR, respectively), were averaged into a new row named ""[PLOTNAME]-AVG"". For some plots with missing data, we were able to extract SOS (start of season)/POS (peak of season)/EOS (end of season) manually through the sapflow data (not available here but will be added as a data package in the future). This was not the case for all plots with missing data, as we only measure sapflow in a subset of our plots, and this was only done for deciduous species where patterns of sapflow and gcc are well-correlated In addition, 2023 phenophase data for evergreen species has not yet been extracted, and these species are currently marked as ""-9999"" in the data file. The raw data, however, is available in the raw and smooth data files. Once we are able to extract phenophase dates for these evergreen species, we will create an updated version of this data package."

The field study was conducted in a lower montane hillslope of the East River watershed, underlain by Mancos Shale, within the lower 140 m section of a transect that extends nearly 1 km to its local peak. The data in this package, in CSV file format, were collected from Fall 2016 to fall 2021, including depth-resolved dynamic water table depths, subsurface water fluxes, solid phase (soil to bedrock) chemical compositions, geochemical properties of porewater and pore-gas, including radio carbon concentrations. The detailed methods of field studies, laboratory chemical analyses, and calculations are described in the Methods section and in the dataset file: Wan_et_al_Methods.pdf. The dataset additionally includes a file-level metadata (flmd.csv) file that lists each file contained in the dataset with associated metadata; and a data dictionary (dd.csv) file that contains column/row headers used throughout the files along with a definition, units, and data type.	The East River (ER) is a snow‐dominated, headwater basin of the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) located in the western United States. The ER is the designated testbed of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area (WFSFA). Through WFSFA, observational networks have been established to measure stream discharge and precipitation chemistry. The ER is considered representative of many snow‐dominated headwaters of the Rocky Mountains. The study domain encompasses nearly 85 square km, a 1.4‐km vertical drop in elevation (4,120 to 2,760 m) and pristine alpine, subalpine, montane, and riparian ecosystems. The ER contains high‐energy mountain streams to low‐energy meandering floodplains and is eroding primarily into the Cretaceous, carbon‐rich, marine shale of the Mancos Formation.

Seward Peninsula, Alaska	Thaw depth was measured by inserting a 1.3 meter probe marked with 5 centimeter increments into the ground until the point of resistance. The probe has a diameter of approximately 10 mm. At each sample location, multiple (3-5) thaw depths were sampled within an area of approximately 2 x 2 meters. The maximum depth was recorded and reported in this data. Soil moisture was measured co-located with the maximum thaw depth measurements using a HydroSense 2 handheld soil moisture sensor with a 20 cm probe (Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah, USA, https://www.campbellsci.com/hs2). The sensor probe was inserted into the ground until the point of resistance or the full length of the probe. At each sample location, multiple (2-3) soil moisture measurements were collected. The maximum soil moisture was recorded and reported in this data. Vegetation height was measured co-located with the maximum thaw depth measurement using a pole marked with 5 centimeter increments. At sample locations with low-stature vegetation, the mean canopy height was estimated at the location of the maximum thaw depth measurement. In tall shrub regions, multiple (2-5) vegetation heights were measured around the location of the maximum thaw depth measurement. The mean canopy height was estimated and reported in this data. The GPS location of the maximum thaw depth was measured using a portable Trimble Geo7X differential GPS connected to a Zephyr Model 2 Dual Frequency GNSS antenna (Trimble Incorporated, Sunnyvale, California, USA). At each location, we logged the location every second for at least 1 minute. We post-processed the location using the nearest available base-station data from the Trimble Reference Network (https://www.trimble.com/trs/findtrs.asp).

In July 2022 Carex aquatilis was resampled from plots 31-35, fifteen leaves per plot, one year after the warming experiment. Field experiments were not conducted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so there was no follow up sampling of Eriophorum angustifolium from the 2019 experiment (plots 21-25). Plots are located within a 1 km2 area centered around 71.275°N, 156.641°W on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO), Utqiagvik, Alaska. The area of sampled leaf material was determined by measuring length and width using a ruler and hand lens. Samples were dried in a ventilated oven (60?70°C) to constant mass. Leaf dry mass was determined using a top pan balance (AND ER-60A; A&D Engineering, San Jose, CA USA). Dried leaves were ground to a powder using a ball mill, then samples for analysis were weighed into tin capsules on a Mettler Toledo AX26 DeltaRange mass balance (Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH USA).

The plants were sampled in July 2022 as part of an ongoing project to improve the understanding of stomatal conductance in the Arctic. Species sampled from the BEO (from a 1 km2 area centered around 71.275°N, 156.641°W) were Arctagrostis latifolia, Arctophila fulva, Carex aquatilis, Eriophorum angustifolium, Petasites frigidus and Salix pulchra. Alnus viridis, Salix glauca and Salix pulchra were collected at the Seward Peninsula sites. All sampled leaves were used for gas exchange measurements prior to analysis of LMA and leaf carbon and nitrogen content. The data and metadata files included in this data package are in .csv format. See related datasets for stomatal response measurements. The Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments: Arctic (NGEE Arctic), was a research effort to reduce uncertainty in Earth System Models by developing a predictive understanding of carbon-rich Arctic ecosystems and feedbacks to climate. NGEE Arctic was supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska. Through observations, experiments, and synthesis with existing datasets, NGEE Arctic provided an enhanced knowledge base for multi-scale modeling and contributed to improved process representation at global pan-Arctic scales within the Department of Energy's Earth system Model (the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, or E3SM), and specifically within the E3SM Land Model component (ELM).	Alaska	Upon completion of each gas exchange measurement, leaf segments of Eriophorum angustifolium, Carex aquatilis, Arctagrostis latifolia, and Arctophila fulva, and full leaves of Petasites frigidus, Salix pulchra, Alnus viridis, and Salix glauca were collected. For Eriophorum angustifolium, Carex aquatilis, Arctagrostis latifolia, and Arctophila fulva, the area of sampled leaf material was determined by measuring length and width using a ruler and hand lens. For Petasites frigidus, and the Salix pulchra collected at the BEO site, the area of sampled leaf material was determined by using a leaf area meter (LI-3100 Area Meter; Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE USA). For Alnus viridis, Salix glauca and the Salix pulchra collected at the Seward Peninsula sites, flatbed scanner and image processing software (ImageJ v 1.53) were used to estimate leaf area. Samples were dried in a ventilated oven (60-70°C) to constant mass. Leaf dry mass was determined using a top pan balance (AND ER-60A; A&D Engineering, San Jose, CA USA). Dried leaves were ground to a powder using a ball mill, then samples for analysis were weighed into tin capsules on a Mettler Toledo AX26 DeltaRange mass balance (Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH USA). Foliar elemental carbon and nitrogen content was quantified at Brookhaven National Laboratory using a Perkin Elmer 2400 Series II CHNS/O Elemental Analyzer, used according to manufacturer's instructions (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA USA).

Unburned_Polygon_A	We weighed out organic layer sub-samples from selected burned and unburned sites from the Kougarok Fire Complex, near Nome, Alaska (USA). These samples did not undergo any incubation or warming treatments. We weighed either one gram or five grams of each sample replicate (staying consistent with incubation weights for corresponding samples mentioned above) and placed them into 50 mL conical tubes. We added 6 mL of milli-Q water to one-gram samples and added 30 mL of mill-Q water to five-gram samples. Once water was added, all conical tubes containing a mixture of organic layer sub-samples and water were placed in a mechanical shaker for approximately one hour. After the hour-period of shaking ended, we stored samples at 4 °C and allowed liquid to separate from solid. Once fully separated, the supernatant was poured through a 0.45-micron filter, and a vacuum was used to maximize filter efficiency. This process effectively extracted any available aqueous carbon available in each organic matter sample. The concentration of organic carbon in aqueous organic matter was determined by acidifying the leachate with concentrated HCl to remove any inorganic carbon and analyzing it for total carbon using a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer. To determine SUVA254, a subsample of the aqueous organic matter was analyzed in the UV-VIS spectrophotometer. We recorded the absorbance value at 254 nm. RGB is a numeric color index measured based on the work by Yang et al. 2015. Using a Motorola phone camera, we took photos of aqueous organic matter (leachate) that was inside 50mL conical plastic tubes. For each picture, we used the image analysis program, ImageJ (https://imagej.net/ij/index.html), and the formula from Yang et al. 2015, to obtain numeric R, G, and B color index values for each leachate sample.

Onset HOBO temperature/RH data loggers (Model MX2301A) were installed on low tree branches at 14 sites in two cross-valley transects and one upvalley region, and took half-hourly air temperature, relative humidity, and dewpoint measurements. Onset pendant water temperature loggers (Model MX2201) were buried nearby just below the soil surface, and took half-hourly measurements of surface soil temperatures. At select sites, timelapse cameras were strapped to trees to take images of the surrounding landscape, providing visual imagery of large-scale snow cover variation through time. Logger data pre-processing was limited to setting all data in UTC and trimming the temperature series for the installation period. Timelapse images were stitched into videos for easy storage and visualization.

Alaska	Soils were collected from the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) in Utqiagvik, Alaska and two Seward Peninsula sites (Teller Road mile marker 27 and Council mile marker 71). Key soil physiochemical properties were measured according to the following methods. Soil organic carbon (SOC) was measured using a LECO Carbon/Nitrogen Analyzer. Gravimetric water content (theta_g) was determined by drying at 105 degrees C for 24 hours. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) measurements were conducted with the ammonium chloride saturation or unbuffered salt extraction method (Sumner and Miller, 1996). Briefly, soils were saturated with 0.2 M NH4Cl solution, shaken and centrifuged; soil was washed with water and again shaken and centrifuged. Soil was washed once more with 0.2 M KNO3, shaken and centrifuged and NH4+ was measured (Chemetrics) in the supernatant to determine CEC. pH measurements were taken in a 1:5 (m:v) soil:water slurry. Soil water retention (SWR) was determined in the dry range with a dew point sensor method (WP4C, METER Group). Soils were intermittently massed and measured for matric potential (with WP4C) during soil drying to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) in the dry range. SWRCs were fit with a power function and SWR was calculated for matric potentials at exactly -1.5 MPa and -100 MPa. Titrations were conducted with 5g of soil and 25 mL of distilled, deionized water. Different amounts of 0.1N HCl or 0.1N NaOH were added to separate 50 mL tubes (between 7 and 9 for each soil) and equilibration was achieved after rocking tubes on a rocking table for 7 days. After achieving equilibrium, the pH of the soil slurries was measured with an Accumet AB15 pH meter (Fisher Scientific, porous ceramic double-junction, Ag/AgCl reference and automatic temperature compensation), which was calibrated with pH 4, 7, and 10 standards. Additional standards at pH 1.69 and 12.46 were used to confirm accuracy of pH measurements below 4 and above 10, respectively. The soil pH buffering capacity (beta) was determined from the reciprocal of the slope of the pH titration curve, using a linear regression of the five points on the curve with the steepest slope. Simulations for the impact of beta on biogeochemical reactions were run using a code developed in R, which included the microbial processes of glucose fermentation, iron reduction, and methanogenesis. The model represents beta as a sink for the net proton change during biogeochemical reactions, and pH response functions were included for iron reduction and methanogenesis.

We measured the stable isotopic composition of the transpiration and the daily transpiration flux sum of three aspen and three engelmann spruce. In both forest stands, we installed a soil profile and measured the soil matric potential at 15, 30, and 60 cm depth as well as the stable isotopes of soil pore water at 5, 10, 30, 60, and 90 cm depths. All isotope measurements were done in situ via vapor probes connected to a cavity ring down spectrometer (Picarro L1240i). We further report the daily meteorological data observed at billy barr near our study site. We also provide for each tree the relative share of root water uptake derived from the isotope measurements via a Bayesian mixing model (MixSIAR). The daily data is provided as a time series in ""Iso_MP_Sap_DataDaily_ESSDiveUpload.csv"" and the units are provided in ""dd.csv""; the location of the instrumented trees and soil profiles are given as latitude and longitude coordinates saved as CSV and KMZ files; and a file-level metadata (flmd.csv) file that lists each file contained in the dataset with associated metadata. The data was gathered to investigate the short-term changes of the water sources (i.e., variation of root water uptake from different soil depths) of the studied subalpine trees. Update 07/16/2025: The relative and absolute plant water uptake depths were grouped to ensure that the MixSIAR model was applied with endmembers that differed in their d2H value by at least 3 permill and at least 1 permill for d18O. Whenever the difference between observed d2H values for two or more probes at neighboring depths was less than 3 permill, we used the average value for the source water endmember. For days at which probes that were not next to each other measurements did not differ at least 3 permill, the average of all probes between these two depths was used as the water source endmember representing the depth range between these two probes."	"The study site was near Gothic, Colorado (38°57'37.9""N 106°59'27.3""W; ), where the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory is located at about 2917 m elevation. A KMZ filed provides the detailed location of each studied tree and soil profile"	We measured the matric potential with sensors (Teros 21, METER, accuracy ±(10% of reading + 2 kPa) from −100 to −5 kPa) installed along two soil profiles at 15, 30, and 60 cm depths, respectively. One soil profile (P1) was located beneath aspen trees and the second one (P2) was in the spruce stand. During installation of the matric potential sensors, a tight connection of the sensor and the surrounding soil was ensured. Three aspen and three Engelmann spruce trees, respectively, were instrumented with heat pulse sap flow sensors (Implexx Sap Flow Sensor, Implexx Sense). The sensors were installed at breast height on the south side of the trees and they were covered with aluminum foil to prevent heat impact from the sun. We calculated based on the sensor measured sap velocity (cm/day) the sap flux volumes (kg/day) based on the sap wood length that we determined from tree cores. We determined the transpiration rate (mm/day) by relating the sap flux to the crown area based on the measured canopy widths (Table 1). Matric potential and sap flow measurements started in Mid-June 2022 and were taken every 10 minutes. Sap flow sensors in 2023 were installed into freshly drilled holes. Daily meteorological data on air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind direction and speed, solar radiation, and precipitation were provided by the nearby (ca. 300 m away) billy barr weather station (38.96021739, -106.9911594, 2917 m elevation) (Western Regional Climate Center, 2024). For the isotopic measurements of soil and plant water, we used an in situ system that is based on the isotopic equilibration method as described by Seeger and Weiler (2021). The applied method is based on the isotopic equilibrium between a liquid water pool and the surrounding vapor in a closed system (Wassenaar et al., 2008). At 100% humidity, the phase change from the liquid water to the vapor results in an equilibrium fractionation, which means that the associated change of the isotope ratio is solely a function of the temperature. Therefore, polyethylene vapor permeable probes were shown to allow for continuous isotopic sampling of soil (Volkmann & Weiler, 2014) and plant water (Volkmann et al., 2016) connecting the probes to a cavity ring-down spectroscope (L2140-i, Picarro Inc.). We installed vapor probes along three soil profiles: One beneath an aspen tree (P1) and one beneath a spruce tree (P2). The vapor probes measurement depths were 5, 10, 30, and 60 cm in all profiles and an additional probe at 90 cm beneath Aspen and 85 cm beneath the spruce. The P1 and P2 profiles were within 30 cm from where the matric potentials were installed, which is why these two measurement locations are called P1 and P2, respectively. We further installed in each of the six trees a vapor probe at the bottom of the stem and sealed off the surrounding of the probes with silicone to prevent water and vapor from going into the drilled holes after the probes were inserted. In 2023, new vapor probes were installed in new boreholes. For calibration purposes, we placed into the soil three standard water bottles containing each 600 ml of water of known isotopic composition (tap water, snowmelt, ocean water) and measured the vapor isotopic composition of their headspace at least every four hours with the same vapor probes as the soil and xylem water. We followed the calibration procedure as outlined in detail by Seeger and Weiler (2021). The isotope measurements of the three standards that were closest in time before and after a measurement with the soil and xylem water vapor probe measurements were used to calculate a calibration equation between the water vapor concentration (ppm H2O) in the cavity of the laser spectrometer and the isotope measurements. This way, any impact of temperature dependent water vapor concentration that impacts the laser absorption in the cavity and also potential drift of the spectrometer was accounted for and we could infer from vapor measurements the liquid water isotope ratios in ‰ relative to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water. As a last step, we calculated daily averages of δ2H, while we did not include δ18O in our analyses due to larger uncertainty related to 18O measurements (Seeger & Weiler, 2021). Rainfall and snow water were sampled for isotope analyses on an event basis at a sampling location at 29 m lower elevation and 3 km south (Williams et al., 2023) and we accounted for a lapse rate (δ2H of -0.24 ‰/100m), which was derived from 33 precipitation events over two years sampled at 2513.6, 2885.5, 3181.5 m elevation, respectively.

NGEE Arctic Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska	Thaw depth, relative dielectric permittivity, and soil temperature were collected along three transects within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska. Measurements were acquired along the transect at 3 m intervals on 2011-09-25, 2011-09-26, 2012-07-18, 2012-09-30, 2014-07-02, 2014-08-15, and 2014-09-14 for the L2 transect (intensive site 0), which is about 470 m long. Similarly, measurements were collected every 3 m on 2012-09-30, 2013-09-30, 2014-07-02, 2014-08-14, and 2014-09-23, and every 1 m on 2013-09-30 along the AB transect (intensive site 1) which is about 500 m long. Thaw depth measurements were obtained with a tile probe. In-situ relative dielectric permittivity measurements were obtained using a soil-moisture-Trase-system time domain reflectometer (TDR) (6050X1 TRASE SYSTEM I) with two 15 or 30 cm waveguides placed 5 cm apart and with a central frequency of approximately 3 GHz. The TDR probe was pushed vertically into the ground. TDR-obtained relative dielectric permittivity values are generally used as a proxy for water content, with low values indicating relatively dryer soils and higher values representing relatively more moist soils. Soil temperatures were measured using an EXTECH Instruments EA15 Thermocouple with two type K bead wire temperature probes, which have a temperature range from −30 to 300 °C, with a 0.1° resolution. In some surveys, both temperature sensors (T1 and T2) were fixed to the tile probe used to measure thaw depth thickness. T2 was located at 10 cm shallower than the base tip of the probe and T1 was located 20 cm above the base tip of the probe. In other surveys one of the temperature sensor was just pushed into the ground 10 cm deep. Equilibrium time was limited to tens of seconds and thus uncertainty in the temperature measurements is high.

This package contains LiDAR-derived canopy height maps for 2015 and 2019, crown polygons derived from the height maps using a segmentation algorithm, and environmental covariates supporting the model of forest growth. Source datasets include August 2015 and August 2019 discrete-return LiDAR point clouds collected by Quantum Geospatial for terrain mapping purposes on behalf of the Colorado Hazard Mapping Program and the Colorado Water Conservation Board. Both datasets adhere to the USGS QL2 quality standard. The point cloud data were processed using the R package lidR to generate a canopy height model representing maximum vegetation height above the ground surface, using a pit-free algorithm. This dataset was compiled to assess how spatial patterns of tree growth in montane and subalpine forests are influenced by water and energy availability. Understanding these growth patterns can provide insight into forest dynamics in the Southern Rocky Mountains under changing climatic conditions. This dataset contains .tif, .csv, and .txt files. This dataset additionally includes a file-level metadata (flmd.csv) file that lists each file contained in the dataset with associated metadata; and a data dictionary (dd.csv) file that contains column/row headers used throughout the files along with a definition, units, and data type.	Snodgrass Mountain	"Point Cloud Subsetting and Reprojection. Point clouds from the original source datasets (.laz format tiles) were reprojected to the study coordinate system (EPSG:32613, WGS84 / UTM Zone 13N) and subset to the region of interest. Projection used the spTransform() function in the package ""sp"", which in-tern used the PROJ library (version 5.2) for reprojection. We used the R package ""lidR"" (version 3.0.4) for subsequent point cloud processing. Bare-earth Surface Generation and Point Cloud Normalization. Raw point clouds included a bare-earth classification provided by the vendor. We used the lidR function tin() to produce a bare-earth surface by triangulating between ground points using the default settings. The resulting surface elevations were subtracted from the point cloud (without rasterizing) to produce a ""normalized"" point cloud with the Z values representing height above the surface. Pit-free Canopy Model Generation. We used a pit-free algorithm to generate a canopy surface (Khosravipour, A., Skidmore, A. K., Isenburg, M., Wang, T., & Hussin, Y. A. 2014. Generating pit-free canopy height models from airborne lidar. Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing, 80(9), 863-872.). This was implemented in the lidR function pitfree(), using height thresholds of 0, 0.5,1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 40 m. The model was gridded at at spatial resolution of 1/3 (0.3333333) m / pixel. Adjacent tiles were buffered by 30m to avoid edge artifacts. Removal of Structures and Artifacts. The raw canopy height model was post-processed to remove artifacts around human-built structures. We clipped the Bing Building Footprints dataset (version 2.0) to our study area and buffered the footprints by 1m before rasterizing the footprint polygons. Pixels within 1m of building footprints were set to a height of zero. Pixels with heights less than zero or greater than the maximum reported heights of trees in CO (54 m) were also set to zero. Rescaling and TIF Generation: We used the GDAL tools gdal_calc, gdal_merge, and gdal_translate to rescaled the height values from meters to millimeters, and convert the floating-point values to unsigned 16-bit integers to reduce the size of the dataset. The resulting dataset was stored as a compressed, cloud-optimized Geotiff. Canopy segmentation. We used a variable-distance local maximum filter to identify putative tree tops independently in both 2015 and 2019 datasets. Local maxima were at least 2 m tall to be considered for segmentation. We then used the ITCSegment algorithm (Dalponte, M. and Coomes, D. A. (2016), Tree-centric mapping of forest carbon density from airborne laser scanning and hyperspectral data. Methods Ecol Evol, 7: 1236–1245. doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12575) to delineate tree crown polygons. Canopy segment statistics. For each crown segment, we calculated the volume under the crown by summing the heights of cells in the canopy height model multiplied by the pixel area. We also filtered the crowns to only those classified as majority conifer in an existing high-resolution vegetation classification based on hyperspectral imagery (Falco N ; M.

The samples used to generate this data set were collected just prior to initiation of deep peat heating (DPH; 03 June 2014), after 3 months (09 September 2014), and after 10 months (16 June 2015). This data set includes the abundances and delta-13C isotopic signatures of individual lipids and of groups of lipids indicating total biomass, fungi, Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, actinomycetes, and anaerobic bacteria. This dataset contains two files in comma separate (*.csv) format. Cores extending to 250 cm (200 cm in June 2015) were collected and subsampled at 10 cm intervals from 0 and 100 cm and 25 cm intervals below 100 cm depth. During the lipid extraction procedure, samples were pooled into the following depth increments in order to obtain sufficient material to achieve adequate lipid yield: 0-20, 20-50, 50-100, 100-150, 150-200, and 200-250cm.	SPRUCE Experiment Site	Study Site Observations occurred at The Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s SPRUCE (Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments) project (Hanson et al., 2017) at S1 bog at the U.S. Forest Service’s Marcell Experimental Forest, in Minnesota, USA (47°30.476’ N; 93°27.162’ W). SPRUCE is an ecosystem-scale study that warms the vegetation and peatland soil profile to a depth of 2 m within 12.8-m diameter open-top enclosures. The peat was heated first at – 2 m for a period of 1 year starting in summer 2014 (deep peat heating phase), then heating of the overlying air began in August 2015 starting the whole ecosystem warming phase of the experiment. Sample Collection: Peat cores were collected on 3 dates (03 June 2014, 09 September 2014, 16 June 2015). On each sampling date, cores extending to 250 cm (200 cm in June 2015) were collected and subsampled at 10 cm intervals from 0 and 100 cm and 25 cm intervals below 100 cm depth. During the lipid extraction procedure, samples were pooled into the following depth increments in order to obtain sufficient material to achieve adequate lipid yield: 0-20, 20-50, 50-100, 100-150, 150-200, and 200-250 cm. Subsamples were immediately placed on dry ice for transport to lab and frozen until processing. Samples were freeze-dried, then ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen prior to lipid extraction and analysis. Phospholipid Fatty Acid Analysis (PLFA) Subsamples from multiple depth increments were composited so that enough sample mass could be obtained. The increments were as follows: 0-20, 20-50, 50-100, 100-150, 150-200, and 200-250 cm. Based on preliminary method testing (Blake, 2017), the following sample weights were used for lipid extraction: 2-g dry weight for the 0-20 cm depth increment, 6-8-g dry weight for increments 20-50 cm, 50-100 cm, and 100-150cm, and 10-g dry weight for increments 150-200 cm and 200-250 cm. The PLFA method was modified from that of Bligh and Dyer (1959) for extractions from peat (Blake, 2017) and for δ13CPLFA analysis (Herman et al., 2012). An initial extraction was performed 3x from each peat sample using a 0.9:1:2 ratio of citrate buffer:chloroform (CHCl3):methanol (MeOH). After an additional centrifugation step to remove remnant peat particles, citrate buffer and CHCl3 extractants were added to bring the final ratio of buffer to CHCl3 to MeOH to 0.9:1:1 for phase separation overnight. The CHCl3 layer was then evaporated and the phospholipid fraction was separated using silica column chromatography. Phospholipids were then methylated using an alkaline methylation procedure (Herman et al., 2012) and analyzed with an Agilent (Santa Clara, California) 7790A GC coupled with an Elementar (Langenselbold, Germany) IsoPrime100 IRMS system. 1,2-dinonadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (19:0 PC; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Alabama, cat # 850367P) was used as a surrogate standard and tridecanoic acid methyl ester (C 13:0; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, cat # T062) was used as an internal standard to convert peak areas to nmol fatty acid g dry peat -1. Estimates of the abundance and isotopic ‰ ratios of several microbial groups were based on signature fatty acids associated with those groups, shown in the table below (Zelles, 1999). The abundance of indicator groups was the sum of the abundances of all constituent lipids. Microbial biomass was determined as the sum of lipids equal to or less than 20:0 carbons in length, not including palmitic acid (16:0) as it is found in high levels in the Sphagnum dominating our study site (Koskimies and Simola, 1980). Raw δ13C data in ‰ units for each lipid were normalized using USGS40 international reference material (L-glutamic acid; δ13C = –26.39 ± 0.04 ‰) and then reported relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB). These data were then corrected for the addition of carbon during the methylation of fatty acids to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) with the following equation (Butler et al., 2003): δ^13 C_PLFA= ((C_PLFA+1)×δ^13 C_FAME-δ^13 C_MeOH)/C_PLFA CPLFA is the number of carbons in each individual lipid before methylation, δ13CFAME is the corrected δ13C value of each measured individual lipid, and δ13CMeOH is the corrected δ13C of the methanol used for the methylation steps determined using elemental combustion analysis (Butler et al., 2003). The methanol used during methylation had a measured δ13C signature of -55.84‰. δ13C values of total biomass and indicator groups were calculated using a weighted average of the individual lipids that make up each group. Averages were weighted based on lipid concentrations and number of carbons using the following equation: weighted average δ^13 C_(microbial group)= (∑#C_PLFA × concentration_PLFA × δ^13 C_PLFA )/(∑#C_PLFA × concentration_PLFA) #CPLFA is the number of carbon atoms in the PLFA, concentrationPLFA is the concentration in the PLFA, and δ13CPLFA is the isotopic signature of the PLFA. Lipids with peak heights below 1nA in intensity were excluded from isotopic analyses, as this is the threshold below which the IRMS cannot reliably determine the isotope ratio of the sample. These values are entered as -9999 along with missing values. Please see User Guide for additional details: SPRUCE_13C-Phospholipid_Fatty_Acid_Abundances_June 2014_June 2015.pdf

The experiments were carried out in the autumn of 2011 and spring of 2012 to examine seasonality in nutrient dynamics. The nutrient limitation status (N-limited, P-limited, co-limited for N and P, or neither N- nor P-limited) of Walker Branch was examined using nutrient diffusing substrata (NDS) in both autumn and spring. Next, a combination of instantaneous and steady-state nutrient releases were used to examine the effect of dual N and P releases on nutrient dynamics and saturation kinetics. Lastly, because the nutrient release results from autumn suggested a strong role of P sorption in P dynamics, laboratory assays were carried out in spring to quantify the importance of P sorption to sediments in Walker Branch. This dataset contains 5 data files in comma-separate (*.csv) format.	Walker Branch Watershed	Site Description: . Walker Branch Watershed (WBW) is a 97.5 ha second-growth forest on the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge Reservation in east Tennessee, USA. There are two headwaters streams that drain the watershed: the West Fork drains 38.4 ha (Figure 2) and the East Fork drains 59.1 ha (Curlin and Nelson 1968). The watershed is underlain by bedrock (Knox Dolomite) with deep soils, primarily Utisols. Vegetation is primarily oaks (Quercus prinus, Quercus alba), tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), red maple (Acer rubrum), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia) (Johnson 1989, Kardol et al. 2010). The climate is typical of the southern Appalachian region, with a mean annual temperature of 14.5ºC and mean annual precipitation of 135 cm (Curlin and Nelson 1968, Johnson 1989). Long-term records have documented a 1.8ºC increase in mean annual air temperature over the past 40 years (Lutz et al. 2012). More detailed site descriptions are available in Curlin and Nelson (1968) and Johnson (1989). The nutrient uptake experiments were carried out in the West Fork of WBW. The West Fork is approximately 300 m in length from the headwaters to the location where the East and West Forks meet. Four perennial springs discharge to the West Fork. The S3 spring that is located approximately 160 m downstream from the headwater springs provides the majority of baseflow compared to the other springs (Curlin and Nelson 1968, Genereux et al. 1993, Figure 2). The stream bed is composed primarily of bedrock outcrops, areas of cobble and gravel, and deposits of organic matter. Stream water nutrient concentrations are low (Mulholland 2004, Lutz et al. 2012) and the snail, Elimia clavaeformis, is the dominant invertebrate in the stream (Newbold et al. 1983, Rosemond et al. 1993, Griffiths and Hill 2014). Nutrient diffusing substrata: Nutrient diffusing substrata (NDS) were used to measure the response of heterotrophic microbial respiration to added nutrients. The NDS were constructed of 50-mL centrifuge tubes filled with a 2% agar solution containing either 0.05 mol/L NaNO3, 0.05 mol/L KH2PO4, both (N + P), or no added nutrients as a control (n=5 for each treatment). NDS were topped with an organic cellulose sponge cloth to select for heterotrophic constituents of stream biofilms (Johnson et al. 2009). NDS were deployed in the stream for 28 days. After this incubation period, the organic substrata were removed from the tubes and placed into dark centrifuge tubes filled with unfiltered stream water (no air bubbles). The centrifuge tubes were then placed in a shaded section of the stream to keep the substrata at ambient temperatures and were left for 4 hours. Microbial respiration was measured as the consumption of dissolved oxygen after the 4-hour incubation period by measuring dissolved oxygen concentration before and after the incubation. Centrifuge tubes containing unfiltered stream water only (n=5) were included to account for background changes in dissolved oxygen concentration. The change in oxygen from the beginning to the end of the incubation was measured with an oxygen probe (YSI-85 probe; Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, Ohio). This method follows that described in Johnson et al. (2009). Nutrient additions: A total of 6 single and dual N and P releases were carried out in Walker Branch in each season (autumn, spring). Separate instantaneous pulse additions (Tracer Additions for Spiraling Curve Characterization; TASCC method described by Covino et al. 2010) were used to quantify nutrient uptake rates and saturation kinetics of N and P individually. A combination of steady-state nutrient injections (Tank et al. 2006) and TASCC instantaneous pulse nutrient additions were used to examine the interaction between N and P uptake. The steady-state nutrient injections were used to increase background stream water concentrations of one nutrient (e.g., N). After stream water (e.g., N) nutrient concentrations were elevated, an instantaneous pulse of the other nutrient (e.g., P) was released. Nutrient uptake rates and kinetics of N and P from the TASCC releases were conducted at background and elevated (low and high) P and N concentrations. These releases are referred to: ‘P alone’, ‘P with N low’, and ‘P with N high’ for P uptake, and ‘N alone’, ‘N with P low’, and ‘N with P high’ for N uptake. Nutrient additions were conducted on November 1-3, 2011 (autumn) and March 20-22, 2012 (spring). In autumn, single nutrient pulse additions were conducted on the first day of fieldwork, P pulses with low and high N concentrations on the second day, and N pulses with low and high P concentrations on the third day. In the spring, all P pulses were conducted on the first day of fieldwork and all N pulses were conducted on the third day. The instantaneous pulse (TASCC) nutrient addition method to estimate nutrient uptake rates and saturation kinetics is detailed in Covino et al. (2010) but will be briefly described here. For each TASCC addition, a solution of either N or P with NaCl as a conservative tracer was added to a 74-m reach of stream. The autumn nutrient solutions consisted of either 25 g KNO3 or 2.5 g KH2PO4 with 400 g NaCl dissolved in 10 L of stream water, and the spring nutrient solutions consisted of either 50 g KNO3 or 2.75 g KH2PO4 with 450 g NaCl dissolved in stream water. The nutrient solution was released over a short (~10 s) period, and specific conductivity was measured every minute at a location 74 m downstream from the release point using a handheld conductivity probe (YSI Model 30; Yellow Springs Instruments). Water samples for N and P analysis (described below) were collected every minute starting when specific conductivity began to increase and stopping once specific conductivity returned to background levels. Five replicate samples from the nutrient release solutions were collected for analysis of N, P, and specific conductivity. For the dual nutrient additions, steady-state nutrient injections were used to increase either N or P concentrations throughout the 74-m stream reach. In autumn and spring, we used a pump (3CKC pump head; Fluid Metering, Inc., Syosset, New York) to add nutrients at a constant rate of 24 mL/min for the low nutrient concentration and 48 mL/min for the high nutrient concentration. In autumn, the nutrient solution contained either 34 g KNO3 or 3.2 g KH2PO4. In the spring, the nutrient solution contained either 303 g KNO3 or 41 g KH2PO4. Water samples were collected at 5 stations longitudinally throughout the 74-m reach both before the steady-state addition and after steady state (i.e., plateau) was reached at the farthest downstream station (74 m). The nutrient concentrations in stream water during the low and high nutrient additions were estimated as the geometric mean of nutrient concentrations from the 5 longitudinal samples at plateau. After plateau samples were collected, a pulse nutrient release was conducted while the stream was enriched at a low concentration of the other nutrient. Water samples were collected and specific conductivity was measured at the farthest downstream station (74 m) during the TASCC release (as described above). Once specific conductivity from the pulse release returned to background levels, the drip rate was increased to achieve the high nutrient concentration. After the high nutrient concentration plateau was reached, water samples were collected at the 5 stations and then a second TASCC pulse release was conducted while the stream was enriched at a high concentration of the other nutrient. All water samples were filtered in the field through Whatman GF/F filters (0.7-µm nominal pore size; Maidstone, England), placed on ice, and then frozen upon return to the laboratory (within a few hours of collection). Nitrate-N concentrations were measured on a DIONEX ICS-2000 ion chromatograph with an AS11-HC column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, California) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations were measured using molybdate-blue colorimetry (APHA 2005) on an autoanalyzer (AA3; Seal Analytical Inc., Mequon, Wisconsin). For all water chemistry analyses, blanks and certified commercial standards were analyzed in each run to check for data quality. The measured and background-corrected nutrient concentration and specific conductivity values for each TASCC release are reported in this dataset. The stream water concentrations from the steady-state nutrient additions are reported in the Griffiths and Johnson 2018 publication in Freshwater Science. Nutrient uptake and saturation kinetic calculations: From the TASCC pulse additions, ambient uptake length (Sw-amb; m), uptake velocity (Vf-amb; mm/min), areal uptake rate (Uamb; µg m–2 min–1), maximum areal uptake rate (Umax; µg m–2 min–1), and the half-saturation constant (Km; µg/L) were calculated (as described in detail in Covino et al. 2010). Uptake length (Sw-add-dyn; m) was calculated for each sample as the negative inverse of the difference in the natural log of the injectate nutrient:specific conductivity ratio and each grab sample’s nutrient:specific conductivity ratio (background corrected) over reach length (74 m). Only data on the falling limb of the pulse addition were analyzed to avoid effects of hysteresis (Trentman et al. 2015). Ambient metrics were calculated as the y-intercept of the linear regression of Sw-add-dyn vs the total nutrient concentration (total [nutrient]): S_(w-add-dyn)=m (total [nutrient]) + (S_(w-amb)) [Eq. 1] where m is the slope of the regression, and total [nutrient] is calculated as the geometric mean of the total observed [nutrient] and the total expected [nutrient] given the conservative tracer (Covino et al. 2010). Ambient uptake velocity (Vf-amb; mm/min) and ambient areal uptake rate (Uamb; µg m–2 min–1) were estimated from ambient uptake length (Sw-amb), where Uamb was calculated by multiplying discharge over width (Q/w) by the ambient stream water nutrient concentration (ambient [nutrient]), and Vf-amb was calculated as Uamb/ambient [nutrient]. Stream discharge (Q) was estimated by integrating under the conductivity pulse of each release and mean stream width (w) was calculated from stream-width measurements taken every ~2 m along the 74-m study reach. Stream velocity was calculated as the time to peak specific conductivity during the TASCC release divided by the stream reach length (74 m). Stream depth was calculated as stream discharge divided by the product of stream velocity and width. To estimate saturation kinetic metrics, areal uptake for each sample (Uadd-dyn) on the falling limb was calculated by multiplying Q/w by the measured and expected geometric mean nutrient concentrations given the conservative tracer concentration divided by the uptake length of the added nutrient (Sw-add-dyn) (Covino et al. 2010). Total areal uptake (Utotal) was then calculated for each sample by summing Uamb and Uadd-dyn. Saturation kinetics (Umax, Km) were calculated by fitting a Michaelis-Menten model to Utotal vs total [nutrient]: U_total= (U_max × total[nutrient])/(K_m + total[nutrient]) [Eq. 2] Uptake length of the added nutrient (Sw-add-dyn), total nutrient uptake (Utotal), and total nutrient concentration are reported in this dataset. Further, the nutrient concentration and specific conductivity of each TASCC nutrient injectate and stream discharge, width, velocity, and depth are reported for each TASCC release in each season. Ambient uptake length (Sw-amb; m), uptake velocity (Vf-amb; mm/min), areal uptake rate (Uamb; µg m–2 min–1), maximum areal uptake rate (Umax; µg m–2 min–1), and the half-saturation constant (Km; µg/L) are reported in the Supplemental Tables associated with the Griffiths and Johnson 2018 Freshwater Science publication. Phosphorus sorption assays: Laboratory P sorption assays used sediments collected from Walker Branch in spring to determine P isotherms (McDaniel et al. 2009) and the phosphorus sorption index (PSI; Bache and Williams 1971). Five cores (6 cm wide × 3 cm deep) were collected from each of 6 locations along the 74-m reach in areas where gravel and fine benthic organic matter (FBOM) accumulate. These 30 cores were composited into one sample, and a subsample of the sediment was wet sieved in the laboratory to produce a <8-mm size fraction for sorption assays. For the P isotherms, seven 40 mL standards (0-2000 µg P/L) made with KH2PO4 and stream water were added to 5 mL of wet sediment (~8 g dry mass) with 3 replicates per standard (n=21) to measure both biotic uptake and abiotic sorption. A second set (n=21) was prepared to measure abiotic sorption by killing biota on sediments with 1 mL HgCl2 (0.2%) for a minimum of 15 min prior to adding standards. Samples were shaken for 16 h and then centrifuged. The supernatant was filtered and analyzed for SRP. We also used a similar method to measure the PSI on both live and killed sediments, but only used 3 standards (0, 50, and 2000 µg P/L) and shook samples for 2 to 3 h prior to filtering and analyzing for SRP. The equilibrium P concentration at zero release or retention (EPC0), where P is neither adsorbed nor desorbed from the sediments, was calculated from the P isotherms. The increase or decrease in P during the assay was scaled to g DM of sediment (µg P/g DM) for each sample against the final equilibrium P concentration in the sample. Then, the x-intercept of this relationship was used to estimate the EPC0 (Froelich 1988, McDaniel et al. 2009). The PSI was calculated with the 2000 µg P/L standard as the amount of P adsorbed by the sediments (µg P/g DM) relative to the natural log of the P concentration remaining (µg P/L) after the assay (Bache and Williams 1971, Meyer 1979). The 50 µg P/L standard from the PSI assay with live sediments was used to estimate the capacity for the sediments to remove P at a concentration and time-scale similar to that of the pulse nutrient additions.

Instruments were deployed at 10 sites in two cross-valley transects as part of the DOE Grant: Seasonal Cycles Unravel Mysteries of Missing Mountain Water organized by Jessica Lundquist (University of Washington), Rosemary Carroll (Desert Research Institute), and Ethan Gutmann (National Center for Atmospheric Research). The data are intended to support hydrologic modeling efforts to better resolve the fate of mountain water, and are published to support studies of surface climate or hydrologic processes in complex terrain. Measurements were collected with low-cost data loggers installed 2 m high on evergreen trees or buried just below the soil surface. A time-lapse camera at one site captures valley-scale seasonal snow cover variability. Dataset files are organized by site and variable (air measurements, ground measurements, or time-lapse video). Air and ground measurements are packaged in LoggerData.zip, and time-lapse imagery is compiled into a short video stored in TimelapseVideos.zip. File-level metadata contains details for each file included in the dataset. A data dictionary provides units and descriptions for column or row names in all files. The locations metadata file describes site characteristics, locations, and associated GPS methods.	Region of study. Bounding box for the mountain region near Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park containing field sites.	Onset HOBO temperature/RH data loggers (Model MX2301A) were installed on low tree branches at 10 sites in two cross-valley transects and took half-hourly air temperature, relative humidity, and dewpoint measurements. Onset pendant water temperature loggers (Model MX2201) were buried nearby just below the soil surface and took half-hourly measurements of surface soil temperatures. At one site, a timelapse camera was strapped to a tree to take images across the transect, providing visual imagery of valley-scale snow cover variation through time. Logger data pre-processing involved converting all timestamps to UTC and trimming the temperature series to match the installation period. Timelapse images were stitched into a video for easy storage and visualization.

Each plot has five Campbell Scientific CS655 soil sensors: three at a depth of 0-10 cm, one at a depth of 20-30 cm, and another at a depth of 40-50 cm. Data in this package were cleaned and formatted to include information about sensor location within the plots. This data package contains one CSV file per year from October 2015 to December 2023, for a total of nine data files, as well as a data dictionary describing the variables.	"These data were collected at the Tropical Responses to Altered Climate Experiment (TRACE) site. The TRACE plots are located near the Sabana Field Research Station in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (El Yunque National Forest) in Luquillo, Puerto Rico. See Kimball et al. (2018) in ""Related References"" for additional site information."	Each of the six experimental plots contain five Campbell Scientific CS655 soil moisture/temperature sensors logging to a Campbell Scientific CS1000 datalogger. In each plot, three sensors are at 0-10 cm depth; one is located at the edge of each plot, one is midway to the center of each plot, and one is at the center of each plot. The remaining two CS655 sensors in each plot are located in the center of the plot, at depths of 20-30 cm and 40-50 cm. The surface sensors (0-10 cm) were installed in 2015, and the deeper sensors (20-30 cm and 40-50 cm) were installed in 2016. Soil moisture represents volumetric water content. Data were filtered to remove timepoints when the dataloggers or sensors were not functioning properly; missing data represent when no data were collected (e.g. due to power outages) or when data were filtered.

The project was designed to experimentally warm P. trichocarpa clones and assess their physiological acclimation of leaves versus roots. Branch cuttings of the Nisqually-1 genotype were obtained from the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) in Stanford, California, and propagated in leach tubes. Ninety genetically identical clones were planted into specially constructed mesocosm growth boxes and grown for an initial six weeks in the greenhouse, and then grown at three temperature treatments for ten weeks. The daytime air temperatures of treatments were approximately 25°C, 29°C, and 33°C. Measurements on plant physiology and growth were conducted at various intervals throughout the experiment. This dataset contains nine data files in comma separate (*.csv) format.	Oak Ridge National Laboratory	"Study Species Description: Western black cottonwood, Populus trichocarpa Torr. & A.Gray ex Hook. (Salicaceae), is a model plant species, native to the northwestern coastal areas of North America. It is a fast-growing species with low wood density, long narrow leaves, and an extensive, aggressive root system. The species can reproduce clonally, like many other members of the willow family, and is cultivated by the North American timber industry for plywood, pulpwood, paper, and biofuel production. The US Department of Energy considers Populus species to be the choice genus of woody biomass production for bioenergy applications because if its fast growth, adaptability, and ease of propagation (5). In the wild, P. trichocarpa can hybridize with other poplar species, and many hybrid varieties have been developed for agriculture. Western black cottonwood was the first woody tree species to have its genome sequenced and mapped (6), with the work mostly having been done at the Joint Genome Institute. Its genome is of modest size for plants, containing about 485 million bases and 45,000 genes (7). The genome that was sequenced is that of “Nisqually-1”, a single female specimen that was collected in eastern Washington State, near the Nisqually River. The native range for the western black cottonwood is the humid coastal forests of the Pacific Northwest from northern California to southern Alaska along the coast, with larger ranges in inland from Oregon to British Columbia, Canada. Within that geographical range, precipitation varies from about 250 mm to >3050 mm, and the growing season ranges from about 70 days in the northern, more inland areas to > 260 days in the southern part. The species can tolerate cold temperatures by going physiologically dormant during the winter months. Minimum and maximum temperatures for the habitat range of P.trichocarpa are 0 to -47°C, and 16 to 47°C, respectively (8). Mesocosm growth boxes and P.trichocarpa clones: Western black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa Torr. & A.Gray ex Hook., Salicaceae) ramets of the Nisqually-1 genotype were planted into leach tubes containing growth medium and allowed to establish for ten months, beginning in October 2018. The growth medium used throughout the experiment was a well-draining potting mix (pH 5.5 - 6.5), consisting of peat moss, vermiculite, perlite and processed pine bark (Farfad 52 mix, SunGro Horticulture, Agawam, MA), mixed with time-release Osmocote Plus Fertilizer (0.7 g kg-1 15-9-12, NPK). Ninety established clones with an average height of 14.4 cm (range: 8.1–24.8 cm) and average basal stem diameter of 4.5 mm (range:2.9–6.5 mm), were transplanted from leach tubes into mesocosm growth boxes on July 29, 2019. Prior to transplanting, in order to standardize clone size, stems were trimmed at the 7th leaf node and any roots extending beyond the bottom of the leach tube were cut off. Mesocosm growth boxes (38 × 23.5 × 18 cm L× W × H, 15.14 L capacity) were constructed from AkroGrid boxes (model 33168, Akro-Mils, Akron, OH), using a modified methodology of Ficken & Warren (9). Three small holes were drilled on either side of the boxes, near the bottom to allow for water drainage. Each box was filled with 3.5 kg. of potting mix and had a 1-micron mesh partition installed to separate one-third of the box volume. The mesh barrier was designed to exclude plant roots but permit the movement of microbes and water between mesocosm portions, effectively creating a soil control for each mesocosm. P. trichocarpa clones were positioned in the middle of the larger compartment, and each compartment was equipped with a PVC soil CO2-efflux collar. Collars were made from schedule 40 PVC (5 cm diameter and 10 cm in length), with twelve 3.7 cm-diameter holes drilled into the portion of the collar that sat below the soil surface. Mesocosm boxes were encased in CoolShield thermal bubble wrap (ULINE, Pleasant Prairie, WI) to mimic natural temperature differences between the soil and air. Growth conditions & experimental warming: The duration of the experiment was 16 weeks, wherein plants were grown at experimental temperatures for ten weeks. Throughout the experiment, axillary sprouts were pruned to constrict plant growth to the main stem. All ninety of the plants were grown together for six weeks to allow them to establish root biomass in mesocosms. During this initial establishment period, the plants were drip irrigated, receiving about 1 liter of water day-1, and they received two doses of soluble fertilizer (about 1.4 g dose-1, Southern Ag Nitrate Special 20-10-20, NPK) roughly two weeks apart. When the plants were 44 days old, sixty of the plants were transferred to two walk-in growth chambers (30 per chamber, CONVIRON, Ontario, Canada). Growth chambers were set to 70% relative humidity and at 29°C and 33°C, respectively, each with a 4°C degree nighttime temperature drop. Growth chamber temperatures were chosen based on the environmental conditions of the greenhouse during the initial establishment period, where temperatures maximized at 25°C with at most a 4°C nighttime decrease. A climate station, with two air thermometers, two relative humidity sensors, two quantum sensors, and 12 soil temperature sensors, was used throughout the experiment and rotated among the three treatments at 2-week intervals to monitor their environmental conditions. The plants grew vigorously, on average >2 cm day-1, were 1.5 to 2 m in height when transferred to the growth chambers, and reached the ceiling in the growth chambers about three weeks into warming. Therefore, at week 10 (day 71) of the experiment, all plants were pruned to 1.5 m height. Additionally, at week 10 (day 71), the experimental treatments were swapped between growth chambers, to spread any potential latent effects of each specific growth chamber over both treatments. Biomass: Plants were harvested, dried, and weighted for total and organ-based (i.e., leaf, stem, and root) biomass measurement. Plants were harvested at various intervals, wherein three plants per treatment were harvested. Harvest dates were: 1) 2019-09-17 (just prior to warming), 2) 2019-09-24 (7 days post-warming), 3) 2019-10-01 (14 days post-warming), 4) 2019-10-28 (41 days post-warming), and 5) 2019-11-12 (56 days post-warming). The remainder of the plants were harvested at the end of the experiment on 2019-11-22. Growth: We measured basal diameter stem growth at two positions on the stem: 5 centimeters above (+5) and below (-5) the first sprout off of the planted clone main ramet. We also measured plant height growth. Measurements of plant stem diameter and height growth were done at four times over the 16-week experiment: 1) just after planting (2019-7-29), 2) at the start of warming (2019-9-16), 3) when plants were trimmed (2019-10-7), and 4) at the end of the experiment (2019-11-22). This dataset presents stem diameter and height growth rates over the various intervals between the four measurement periods CO2-response Curves: CO2-response curves were done every two weeks using the Li-6800. The light level was set to a non-limiting 1000 µmols mol-1. Leaf VPD was maintained at 1.25 KPa, and the chamber air temperature was set to the ambient conditions of the growth environment, which varied over time and by the experimental treatment. Chamber CO2 concentration was cycled across the following reference IRGA concentrations in µmols per mol: 400,300,200,100,50,375,425,600,800,1000,1200,1500,2000,300. (note: the last data point was typically left out when fitting the Farquhar-von Cammerer-Berry (FvCB) model of photosynthesis, it was included in the cycle to get the machine back close to 400 ppm chamber [CO2] for the next leaf). Light-response Curves: Light-response curves were done every two weeks using the Li-6800. Chamber incoming CO2 concentration was held constant at 400 µmols mol-1, leaf VPD was maintained at 1.25 KPa, and the chamber air temperature was set to the ambient conditions of the growth environment, which varied over time and by the experimental treatment. Light (PPFD) incident on the leaf was varied from high intensity to low in at the following 15 levels (in µmols photon m2 sec-1): 2000,1800,1500,1200,1000,800,600,400,200,150,100,75,50,25,0. This dataset contains gas exchange measurement data in the simplest form possible, containing all the variables needed to fit the nonlinear regression model of the non-rectangular parabola of Marshall and Biscoe (2). From fits of that model, key photosynthetic parameters related to the light reactions of photosynthesis (e.g., the light compensation point and the apparent quantum yield) can be derived. For the paper, this was done using R code written by Mason Heberling (3). Photosynthetic-temperature Response Curves: Photosynthetic-temperature response curves were done every two weeks using the Li-6800. Chamber incoming CO2 concentration was held constant at 400 µmols mol-1, leaf VPD was maintained at 1.25 KPa, and the light level in the leaf chamber was set to a non-limiting 1000 µmols photon per square meter per second. The chamber air temperature was varied, and leaf photosynthesis was allowed to stabilize before logging the data point. Chamber air temperature was varied at about ± 10°C from growing temperatures from low to high temperature. The sequence of Li-6800 air temperature variation for photosynthetic temperature response curves was as follows (in °C): Ambient & T1 sequence: 8,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40,42; T2 sequence: 20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40,42,44; T3 sequence: 24,26,28, 30,32,34,36,38,40,42,44,46,48. This dataset contains gas exchange measurement data in the simplest form possible, containing all the variables needed to fit linear quadratic regression models. From quadradic parabola fits key photosynthetic parameters related to the temperature sensitivity of photosynthesis (e.g., Topt, Amax at Topt) can be derived. The rightmost four columns contain leaf functional trait values for specific leaf area (SLA, leaf % nitrogen, leaf % carbon, and leaf mass nitrogen per area. Those leaf functional traits were measured on 6 leaf punches taken using an 18.5mm Ø leaf punch (2.69 cm2 area, about the size of a US Nickle) from the leaf tissue where the temperature response curve was measured. Values for SLA were averaged among all 6 punches, and the punches were homogenized into one leaf tissue sample, which was measured for leaf carbon and nitrogen (using an elemental analyzer). Leaf Dark Respiration-temperature Response Curves: Leaf dark respiration-temperature response curves were done every two weeks using the Li-6800. Respiration-temperature response curves were run concurrently with photosynthesis-temperature response measurements, in that temperature was increased with the light level in the leaf chamber at 1000 µmols m-2 sec-1. Then the light level was decreased to 0, and the temperature was decreased, measuring leaf dark respiration. Chamber incoming CO2 concentration was held constant at 400 µmols mol-1, leaf VPD was maintained at 1.25 KPa, and the light level in the leaf chamber was off. The chamber air temperature was varied, and leaf respiration was allowed to stabilize before logging the data point. Chamber air temperature was varied at about ± 10°C from growing temperatures in a decreasing fashion. The sequence of Li-6800 air temperature variation for photosynthetic temperature response curves was as follows (in °C): Ambient & T1 sequence: 42,40,38,36,34,32,30,28,26,24,22,20,18; T2 sequence: 44,42,40,38,36,34,32,30,28,26,24,22,20; T3 sequence: 48,46,44,42,40,38,36,34,32,30,28,26,24. This dataset contains gas exchange measurement data in the simplest form possible, containing all the variables needed to fit linear, exponential models. From the exponential linear model fits key photosynthetic parameters related to the temperature sensitivity of dark respiration (e.g., Q10 values) can be derived. The rightmost four columns contain leaf functional trait values for specific leaf area (SLA), leaf % nitrogen, leaf % carbon, and leaf mass nitrogen per area. Those leaf functional traits were measured on six leaf punches 18.5mm Ø leaf punch (2.69 cm2 area, about the size of a US Nickle) from the leaf tissue where the temperature response curve was measured. Values for SLA were averaged among all 6 punches, and the punches were homogenized into one leaf tissue sample, which was measured for leaf carbon and nitrogen (using an elemental analyzer). Root Tissue Respiration-temperature Response Curves: Root tissue respiration-temperature response curves were done twice during the experiment. Data were collected at the last two plant harvests prior to the conclusion of the experiment, on 2019-10-29 and 2019-11-12 (the experiment concluded with the final plant harvest on 2019-11-22). Measurements were done using the Li-6800 attached to a Walz temperature-controlled respiration chamber 3010-GK01 model (Heinz Walz GmbH, Eiffeltrich, Germany). Whole plant root systems were washed, and approximately 100 grams of fresh root biomass from the most distal end of the root system was cut off and placed in the Walz chamber. Incoming CO2 concentration and relative humidity were held constant at 400 µmols mol-1 and 70%, respectively. The chamber was covered with thick paper to prevent light from entering. The temperature in the Walz chamber was precisely controlled using the GFS-Win software, where it was increased from 15 to 50°C in 2.5°C increments. Li-6800 IRGA readings were allowed to stabilize before data point logging; Stability criteria (assessed on the sample IRGA) were ΔH2O.meas2 slope and standard deviation both < 0.1 mmol per mol (water vapor) & ΔCO2.meas2 slope < 0.25 and standard deviation < 0.1 µmols per mol CO2, over a period of 15 seconds. This dataset contains gas exchange measurement data in the simplest form possible, containing all the variables needed to fit non-linear models relating root tissue respiration rates to temperature. We used the following equation from Palta & Noble (3): R_T=R_0 (c-bT)^(T/10), where R is root respiration at temperature T, R_0 is root respiration at 0°C, and b and c are constants which describe the slope and intercept, respectively, of the Q10 vs. T relationship. Survey Measurements of Leaf Photosynthesis (gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence): Survey measurements of leaf photosynthesis (gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence) were done weekly during the Poplar Phys experiment using a Li-COR Li-6800 portable photosynthesis system. Chamber incoming CO2 concentration was held constant at 400 µmols mol-1, leaf VPD was maintained at 1.25 KPa, and the light level in the leaf chamber was set to a non-limiting 1000 µmols m2 sec-1. The flow rate was 600 µmols mol-1, and the chamber air temperature was set to match the environmental conditions at the time of measurement. A pulse-modulated, multi-phase fluorometer induction flash followed by a dark pulse was used to measure chlorophyll fluorescence, using the following parameters: measuring beam - dark mod rate = 5 KHz, light mod rate = 50 KHz, flash mod rate = 250 KHz, averaging interval = 15 seconds; multiphase flash - red target = 10000 µmols m2 sec-1, phase 1,2 & 3 = 300 ms, ramp = 40%, output rate = 500 Hz, margin = 5, dark pulse - far-red target = 25 µmols m2 sec-1, duration = 5s, before & after = 1s, margin = 5. Four stability criteria were used over a 15-second window: 1) ΔH2O.meas2 (mmols mol-1) – measures the difference in [H2O] between the reference and sample IRGA, slope < 0.5. 2) ΔCO2.meas2 (µmols mol-1) – measures the difference in [CO2] between the reference and sample IRGA, slope < 1 & standard deviation < 0.75. 3) gsw (mols m2 sec-1) – the calculated rate of leaf stomatal conductance to water vapor, slope < 0.1. 4) A (µmols m2 sec-1) – calculated rate of leaf CO2 assimilation, slope < 0.5 standard deviation < 0.5. This dataset contains only the essential leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. Survey Measurements of Belowground CO2 Efflux: Survey measurements of belowground CO2 efflux were taken weekly throughout the Poplar Phys experiment. The experimental set involved mesocosm growth boxes that were partitioned into two sections using a 1-micron mesh, which prevented root growth (but permitted the flow of water, microbes and fungi) from one-third of the growth box. The poplar clone was grown in the remaining two-thirds of the mesocosm growth box volume. In each section of the mesocosm, a 5 cm diameter PVC soil CO2 efflux collar was installed into the soil during clone planting. Collars were 10 cm long and had twelve large (3.7 cm diameter) holes drilled into the portion of the collar that sat below the soil level. This design allowed us to repeatedly measure the ""plant + soil"" and ""soil"" CO2 efflux. Measurements were done weekly using a Li-6252 Infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (Li-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The IRGA was connected to an N2 carrier gas stream which was regulated to flow through the IRGA at a rate of 0.1 liters per minute. PVC collars were capped (using a 5cm diameter PVC cap equipped 20mm butyl septums) with 1, and the headspace air was mixed by using a 50mL syringe (3x pumping). Then a 1 mL air sample was collected from the headspace and injected into the IRGA via the N2 carrier gas, and the total integration value was recorded (this is the T0 measurement). Capped collars were incubated (i.e., accumulated belowground CO2 efflux) for at least an hour, and a second measurement (T1) was taken using the same method (headspace mixing followed by analyzing a 1 mL gas sample). The incubation length was closely monitored and recorded, and (accounting for any variation in incubation time) the difference in the T1 and T0 measurements were used to calculate soil CO2 efflux rates. Li-6252 integration values were converted to CO2 concentrations using the standard curves, which were done at the beginning and end of each measurement cycle. The data are given in the simplest form, with one row per chamber (i.e., CO2 efflux collar) per sampling period.

The goal of this project was to evaluate the effect of temperature on organic-matter decomposition in a stream ecosystem to better understand how carbon dynamics across terrestrial-aquatic carbon interfaces may change with warming. The West Fork is a spring-fed headwater stream and the spring inputs create a natural longitudinal temperature gradient. In winter, the upstream sites near the springs are warmer due to the spring input. In summer, the temperature gradient reverses and the upstream sites are cooler. One experiment examined the decomposition of senesced leaves from 3 tree species (red maple [Acer rubrum], tulip poplar [Liriodendron tulipifera], and white oak [Quercus alba]) along the temperature gradient in winter (December 2011 - March 2012). The second experiment examined the breakdown of cotton strips, a substrate of consistent quality (95% cellulose), along the temperature gradient with approximately month-long incubations over ~2 years (August 2011 to October 2013). This dataset contains six data files in comma separate (*.csv) format.	Walker Branch Watershed	Site Description: Walker Branch Watershed (WBW) is a 97.5 ha second-growth forest on the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge Reservation in east Tennessee, USA. There are two headwaters streams that drain the watershed: the West Fork drains 38.4 ha and the East Fork drains 59.1 ha (Curlin and Nelson 1968) (Figure 2). The watershed is underlain by bedrock (Knox Dolomite) with deep soils, primarily Utisols. Vegetation is primarily oaks (Quercus prinus, Quercus alba), tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), red maple (Acer rubrum), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia) (Johnson 1989, Kardol et al. 2010). The climate is typical of the southern Appalachian region, with a mean annual temperature of 14.5ºC and mean annual precipitation of 135 cm (Curlin and Nelson 1968, Johnson 1989). Long-term records have documented a 1.8ºC increase in mean annual air temperature over the past 40 years (Lutz et al. 2012). More detailed site descriptions are available in: Curlin and Nelson (1968) and Johnson (1989). The organic-matter decomposition study was carried out in the West Fork of WBW. The West Fork is approximately 300 m in length from the headwaters to the location where the East and West Forks meet. Four perennial springs discharge to the West Fork. The S3 spring that is located approximately 160 m downstream from the headwater springs provides the majority of baseflow compared to the other springs (Curlin and Nelson 1968, Genereux et al. 1993, Figure 2). The stream bed is composed primarily of bedrock outcrops, areas of cobble and gravel, and deposits of organic matter. Stream water nutrient concentrations are low (Mulholland 2004, Lutz et al. 2012) and the snail, Elimia clavaeformis, is the dominant invertebrate in the stream (Newbold et al. 1983, Rosemond et al. 1993, Griffiths and Hill 2014). Leaf-litter breakdown: Leaf-litter breakdown rates were calculated for leaves from 3 tree species in 5 locations along the downstream temperature gradient in winter. The leaf-litter decomposition experiment followed a typical litterbag approach (Benfield 2006). Leaves from 3 species were used in the experiment: red maple (Acer rubrum), tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and white oak (Quercus alba). In autumn 2011, abscised, senescent leaves of tulip poplar, red maple, and white oak were collected daily from tarps laid on the forest floor in WBW. After collection, the leaves were air dried in the laboratory 2 weeks before constructing the litterbags. A total of 12.0 g (± 0.1 g dry mass) of dried red maple, tulip poplar, or white oak leaves were placed in each litterbag. The nylon litterbags were 37.5 cm long, 20.0 cm wide, and had a mesh size of 3 x 3 mm to allow aquatic invertebrates access to the leaf material contained in each litterbag. The litterbags were deployed in the West Fork on December 15, 2011 (Figure 3). Twelve litterbags per litter type were attached to strings and then to a cinder block to hold the litterbags in place. The 12 litterbags per type were placed in each of 5 sites (sites numbers 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7). Only 4 litterbags of white oak leaves were deployed at site 6 due to a limited number of white oak litterbags. The sites (and distances downstream from the largest spring [S3]) where the litterbags were deployed were as follows: site 1 = 10 m, site 3 = 46 m, site 5 = 103 m, site 6 = 133 m, site 7 = 162 m (Figure 2). The litterbags were retrieved 5, 26, 55, and 90 days after deployment (final pick up date was March 14, 2012). On the December 15, 2011 deployment date, 3 replicates per litter type were brought into the field and then immediately returned to the laboratory to account for mass loss due to handling and to measure initial mass. On each collection date, the litterbags were retrieved from each site and placed into pre-labeled plastic bags. A subsample (~0.1 g dry mass) of leaf litter from each litterbag was removed for a microbial respiration analysis. The litterbags were then placed on ice and returned to the laboratory for processing. The leaf litter was removed from each litterbag and washed over nested 1-mm and 500-µm sieves. All leaf litter on the 1-mm sieve was collected for the mass loss measurement, and all invertebrates on both 1-mm and 500-µm sieves were collected for numeration. The cleaned leaf litter was placed into paper bags and dried at 60ºC for 48 hours. The leaf litter was then weighed to estimate dry mass (grams; to the nearest 0.1 g) and a subsample was removed for ash-free dry mass (AFDM) determination. To measure AFDM, approximately 1 g of dry mass was placed into a pre-weighed aluminum pan, weighed, combusted at 500ºC for 4 h, and then re-weighed. Ash-free dry mass was calculated as the difference between dry and ashed masses. The AFDM of the entire sample was then calculated based on the dry mass of sample used for AFDM determination and the total dry mass of sample. The ~0.1 g of dry mass collected for the microbial respiration assay was also included in this total. For each litter type in each site, the breakdown coefficient (k, /day) was calculated as the slope of the natural log of AFDM remaining over time, and a temperature-corrected breakdown coefficient (k, /degree day) was also calculated by substituting degrees days for time (Benfield 2006). Degree days were calculated as the sum of the mean daily stream water temperature at each site for each incubation period. Microbial respiration: Microbial respiration was measured in the field on all 3 litter types on each collection date (days 5, 26, 55, and 90) and at each site throughout the leaf-litter decomposition experiment. A subsample of ~0.1 g of litter from each retrieved litterbag was rinsed with stream water, placed into a 60 mL amber polypropylene tube filled with stream water (no air bubbles), and then capped. The initial dissolved oxygen concentration of the stream water was measured prior to filling the tubes using a hand-held dissolved oxygen sensor (YSI ProODO). Three ‘control’ tubes per site filled with stream water only were used to account for changes in background dissolved oxygen concentrations. All tubes were then placed in the stream at each of the 5 sites (the same site where the litterbags were retrieved) for 3 hours. After the 3-hour incubation period, the dissolved oxygen concentration in each tube was measured. The change in dissolved oxygen concentration before and after the incubation period was used to calculate microbial respiration. The dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated following the manufacturer’s instructions prior to each use. After the microbial respiration measurement, the subsample of litter was returned to the laboratory and dry mass and AFDM were measured (and the AFDM of the subsample was also included in the measurement of mass loss). Microbial respiration was expressed as mg O2 g-1 AFDM h-1. Invertebrate density: Invertebrate density was measured on all 3 litter types on each date (days 5, 26, 55, and 90) and at each site throughout the leaf-litter decomposition experiment. All invertebrates from each litterbag that were collected on the nested 1-mm and 500-µm mesh sieves were immediately stored in 15 mL glass scintillation vials in 80% ethanol. Because the snail Elimia clavaeformis is dominant invertebrate in Walker Branch (Figure 4), all snails and all other invertebrates were counted separately. Invertebrate (or snail) abundance was expressed as the number of individuals per litterbag, and invertebrate (or snail) density was expressed as the number of individuals per g AFDM of litter remaining in each litterbag. Cotton-strip decomposition experiment: Cotton-strip tensile loss was measured at each of the 7 sites every ~35 days for ~2 years. There were a total of 22 deployments over the 2-year period, with the first deployment beginning on August 10, 2011 and the last deployment beginning on October 1, 2013. The 7 sites used in the experiment were as follows (with distance in meters downstream from the largest [S3] spring): site 1 = 10 m, site 2 = 29 m, site 3 = 46 m, site 4 = 75 m, site 5 = 103 m, site 6 = 133 m, site 7 = 162 m. Five (1, 3, 5, 6, 7) of these 7 sites were used in the leaf-litter decomposition experiment. Cotton strips were 80 mm in length and 25 mm in width, and were cut from bolts of Fredrix-brand unprimed 12-oz. heavy-weight cotton fabric (Style #548; Slocum et al. 2009). The specific methods to make cotton strips are described in Tiegs et al. (2013). A cable tie was inserted through a hole made with a small pin near the top of each cotton strip. Three cotton strips (3 replicates per site) were then attached to a string and the string was attached to a brick that was placed at each site in the stream. The cotton strips were incubated for approximately 35 days at a time. After the incubation period, the cotton strips were retrieved from the stream, cleaned in 80% ethanol, and air dried. To measure the tensile strength of the cotton strips, the ends of each strip were placed in the grips of a tensiometer (Mark-10 brand, Model #MG100) located at Oakland University. Each cotton strip was pulled at a rate of 2 cm/min until it tore, and the tensile strength achieved during the pull was recorded. Tensile loss of each cotton strip (%/day) was calculated as: Tensile loss= (((Tensile strength_REF - Tensile strength_TRT) / Tensile strength_REF ) × 100) / Incubation time where Tensile strengthTRT is the tensile strength recorded for each cotton strip incubated in the field, Tensile strengthREF is the mean tensile strength of 6 cotton strips that were not incubated in the field, but were cleaned with 80% ethanol and air dried, and Incubation time was the total number of days the cotton strips were deployed in the stream (Tiegs et al. 2013). Tensile strength was also calculated per degree day by replacing ‘Incubation time’ with ‘degree days’. Degree days were calculated as the sum of the mean daily stream water temperatures over the Environmental data: Stream water temperature: Temperature was measured every hour using temperature loggers (TidbiT v2, Onset Computer Corporation, accuracy = 0.2ºC) placed in the largest (S3) spring and at each site (1-7) in the West Fork of Walker Branch. Temperature measurements began at sites 1-7 on August 1, 2011, and began at the S3 spring on December 16, 2011. Data are missing for 7 days in August/September 2011 from sites 1 and 2 when the loggers were out of water. Mean daily stream water temperature was calculated from the hourly data. Diel temperature range was calculated as the maximum hourly temperature measured on a given day minus the minimum hourly temperature measured on that same day. Stream water chemistry: Water samples for chemistry analysis were collected at 5 sites along the downstream temperature gradient on days 55 and 90 of the leaf-litter decomposition experiment. The 5 sampling sites were the same 5 sites used in the leaf-litter decomposition experiment. Three filtered water samples (Whatman GF/F; 0.7 μm nominal pore-size) were collected from each site on each sampling date into acid-washed, HDPE bottles, and frozen at -20ºC until analysis. To accompany the cotton-strip decomposition experiment data, reported chemistry data are the average nutrient concentrations calculated for each deployment period. All water samples were analyzed for nitrate-N, ammonium-N, and soluble reactive phosphorus-P using standard methods. Nitrate-N concentrations were measured using the cadmium reduction method, ammonium-N concentrations were measured using the phenol-hypochlorite method, and soluble reactive phosphorus-P (SRP) concentrations were measured using the molybdate-antimony method (APHA 2005) on an autoanalyzer (AA3, SEAL Analytical). Stream water chemistry analyses followed the QA/QC protocols for the analyzer, including calibration curves, QC (standard checks), and baseline and drift checks. The standards used for the calibration curve were diluted from stock solutions (nitrate: SM-772-00; ammonium: SM-772-002, phosphate: SM-772-003) from High-Purity Standards (Charleston, SC). For additional information on the nutrient analyses, see Mulholland (2004) and Lutz et al. (2012). Stream discharge: Stream water level was measured in a stilling well beside a v-notch weir located at the downstream end of the West Fork of Walker Branch (just upstream of where the East and West Forks meet). Stream water level was measured every 15 minutes using a compact bubble water level sensor (CS471, Campbell Scientific) attached to a datalogger (CR1000, Campbell Scientific). Logged water level was checked via a manual measurement of water level every week or month. Stream discharge was calculated using established relationships with water level and the v-notch weir (Curlin and Nelson 1968). To accompany the cotton-strip decomposition experiment data, reported discharge data are the average discharge values calculated for each deployment period.

There are two compressed (.zip) files that contains synthetic (Synthetic_soiltemp_Teller.zip) and field (Field_soiltemp_Teller.zip) data. There is one MATLAB file that requires MATLAB to execute but any text editor can open it. The Synthetic_soiltemp_Teller.zip file includes 5 comma-delimited data files (.csv) each of which contains soil temperature time series generated through forward modeling (i.e., heat-conduction process in a heterogeneous medium using an explicit finite difference method) to mimic various types of temperature gradients, trend and fluctuations. These synthetic soil temperatures were used to investigate the impact of different environmental conditions on the uncertainty of thermal diffusivity estimates. The Field_soiltemp_Teller.zip file contains 28 comma-delimited data files (.csv) out of which (a) 27 files includes soil temperature time series recorded from 27 temperature probes located in a site along Teller Road about 40 km northwest of Nome, Alaska (64.72°N, 165.94°W), (b) one includes the name and coordinates of the 27 probes. These field soil temperatures were used to infer soil thermal diffusivity at numerous locations and depths in a discontinuous permafrost environment, and to evaluate the links between the estimated soil thermal diffusivity values and soil physical properties. The comma-delimited data files (.csv) of the synthetic and field soil temperature time series includes date and time (UTC) in the first column and soil temperature from 5 cm below the ground surface to 1.05 m depth (with 5 or 10 cm spacing between sensors) in the other columns. The measurements were acquired every 15 minutes.

NGEE Arctic was supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska.

NGEE Arctic Teller Site, Mile Marker 27, Alaska	"Synthetic soil temperature The synthetic soil temperature fields are generated through forward modeling (i.e., heat-conduction process in a heterogeneous medium using an explicit finite difference method) with initial, top, and bottom boundary conditions set equal to the temperature time series observed at a monitoring site in Alaska during summer (Romanovsky et al. 2020) and autumn (this dataset), and by assuming a soil column composed of three layers (i.e., top layer at 0.05-0.1 m, middle layer at 0.1-0.42 m, and bottom layer at 0.42-1.05 m). The thermal diffusivity in the three layers is assumed to be constant over time and equal to 0.16, 0.27 and 0.43 mm2s-1 for the case of summer temperatures and 0.25, 0.75 and 0.6 mm2s-1 for autumn. The forward modeling function heatEq1D_heter.m was used to generate the synthetic datasets. The function computes the 1D diffusion equation in a heterogeneous medium according to Equation on page 246 of the book ""Finite difference computing with PDEs"" by Hans Petter Langtangen and Svein Linge. The above-mentioned Equation is used with theta=0 that corresponds to a discretization based on a Forward Euler scheme in time and a centered difference in space. Field soil temperature The field soil temperatures were recorded using the Distributed Temperature Profiling (DTP) system described in Dafflon et al., 2022."

Below are the auxiliary plot information that contributors should assemble when synthesizing a dataset according to PAVC. Clean the cover values: - Correct cover values that, when converted to float, raise a data-type error - For example, ""Trace"" was sometimes used instead of 0.01 - Human error - If applicable, convert 0.0 cover to a trace value like 0.01. Some datasets indicate trace with a small percent, with the text 'Trace', 'T', etc. Some datasets include 0 cover to mean that a species was present in the plot but at very trace amounts. In our database, we standardize trace by assigning a small value like 0.01 to the 0 cover values if applicable. - Ensure cover is represented as a percent - Older plots used Braun-Blanquet or Westoff oridnal codes that indicate a range of cover; the mid-point percentage was used as the representative percent cover value If working with ordinal cover codes, ensure you know the percentage ranges that represent each code---this can vary from project to project. Species and PFT standardization: - Join the species names from your cover table to the species name in the AKVEG Species Checklist to identify potential habits and accepted species names You'll be happy to know that we wrote a big 'ole function for this in our support python module. You should use that to match your table's species names to the AKVEG checklist. - Join the species names from your cover data to the species name in the Leaf Habit Supplementary Table from Macander et al. (2020) to assign shrubs/trees a leaf retention type (deciduous, evergreen) - Export the join of species names, their associated ""potential"" accepted names, and growth habits The list of potential accepted names is supposed to aid the user in assigning an accepted name. If there was no match between your species name and an AKVEG species name, you should consult with an expert to assign an accepted species name, author, and naming authority. - Manually ID one accepted species name for each of your dataset's species names. The manual species name adjudication process is the most time-consuming component of this project. The species names from your data table should be creafully assigned an accepted species name. You also should know the author of the species name, as well as the authority you referenced during accepted name assignment. You'll also need to assign whether the name you've chosen is at the family, genus, species, subspecies, variety, or type (functional type) level. PFT aggregated: - Aggregate species-level fcover to PFT-level fcover by grouping species into their PFTs and summing We have specific PFT categories: lichen and bryophytes (sum = non-vascular), graminoid, deciduous shrub, evergreen shrub, deciduous tree, evergreen tree, and other; as well as litter, all represented as absolute foliar cover. Water and bare ground are also necessary, but they should be measured as top cover."

Formation of thermokarst channels shifts soil biogeochemical redox dynamics and impacts carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes. This experimental study explores how soil saturation and drainage drives biogeochemical redox cycling and carbon decomposition in two soil types collected from the NGEE-Arctic field site in Council, Alaska. Soil cores were collected from a wet, upland soil overlain by low shrubs and tussocks and a saturated, thermokarst soil dominated by sedge. After removing surface vegetation, two cores for each soil type were homogenized across geochemically similar depth increments and packed into a PVC tube instrumented with volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, oxygen (O2) sensors, temperature sensors, and microrhizon porewater samplers. Then each experiment (upland and thermokarst) underwent three experimental phases: drainage 1, saturation, and drainage 2. During the 90 day experiments, VWC and O2 were measured continuously and porewater samplers were used for discrete measurements of pH, ferrous and total iron (Fe), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and SUVA, and other dissolved species. Headspace samples in the the column were used to determine fluxes of CO2 and CH4. This dataset includes initial soil core geochemical characterization and column experiment continuous sensor measurements, outflow and porewater measurements, and gas flux measurements. Additional datasets include pre and post experiment soil geochemical measurements and microbial community analysis.

Seward Peninsula, Alaska	Field Site Description and Sampling Gelisol soils were collected from the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE) -Arctic site near Council Road mile 71 in the Seward Peninsula of Alaska, United States. Thermokarst channels and lakes have developed at this site as a result of land subsidence promoted by thermal erosion and thawing permafrost. The thermokarst channels were inundated with water, whereas the adjacent wet, acidic upland tundra had a high volumetric water content (maximum near 0.6 m3/m3 in the summer, but soils were not inundated. Vegetation in the thermokarst channels was dominated by wet graminoid and moss plant functional types (PFTs), and the upland tundra was characterized by deciduous low shrub, dry graminoid, and lichen PFTs. Tundra core samples were collected from the site in July 2018 and stored frozen. Upland cores were obtained using a modified SIPRE auger (Jon’s Machine Shop; Fairbanks, AK) with a Powerhead motor containing a sterilized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) liner. Replicate cores NGADG0189 and NGADG0183 were collected from the same location within a meter of each other (Lat. 64.859833 Long. -163.698213) in an upland area with a thaw depth of 63 cm. Both soil cores were 72 cm long with 3-inch diameters, and the core holes were 97 cm deep, reflecting compression of the litter and organic layers during coring. The surface soil volumetric water content was 49%. A 2-inch diameter gouge auger (AMS) was used to collect two cores, NGADG0184 and NGADG0185, from a water-saturated thermokarst channel (Lat. 64.860044 Long. -163.697718) with a thaw depth >110 cm. The cores were 71 and 68 cm long, respectively, and were transferred to sterile liners in the field. All soil cores in liners were sealed, transported in blue ice-filled coolers, frozen, and shipped to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) with dry ice. Soil cores were stored in a chest freezer at -20 °C prior to characterization and analysis. Soil Characterization Frozen soil cores were partially thawed for six hours in a vinyl, anoxic glove bag adapted to accommodate a core-length transfer chamber (Coy Laboratory Products). The chamber utilized a nitrogen atmosphere with 1-2% hydrogen gas. Soils were sectioned into 10 cm increments and thawed for another two hours (on ice packs to maintain low soil temperatures) before subsamples were taken from each increment to analyze water content, pH, iron concentrations, and both carbon and nitrogen in triplicate. Remaining soil from each increment was stored frozen until measurements were complete (approximately 1 week). Two cores each from the upland and thermokarst locations were processed and characterized in 10 cm increments. Three sub-samples from each increment were analyzed for each analysis. Gravimetric soil water contents were analyzed by measuring mass before and after drying in a 105 °C oven overnight. Soil pH was determined via KCl extraction (pHKCl); this method produces more stable pH measurements, but underestimates the pH relative to water measurements. pHKCl was determined in a slurry of 1 M KCl (1:5, mass:volume) with air-dried soil (n=3) using an Accumet Basic AB15 bench pH meter with a double-junction pH/ATC combination electrode (Fisher Scientific). This system was calibrated between pH 4 and 10 at ambient temperature using buffer standards (Orion). Exchangeable iron was determined using a nitrogen sparged 1 M KCl extraction solution (1:10, m:v) that was shaken for 30 minutes under anaerobic conditions before analysis using the 1,10-phenanthroline colorimetric assay (HACH 8008 FerroVer for total iron and HACH 8146 Ferrous Iron assay for reduced iron). Absorbance was measured with a UV-Visible absorption spectrophotometer (Beckman DU800) at 510 nm. The total iron assay includes a reductant, and the Fe(II):Fe(total) ratio was determined from extracted Fe(II) and Fe(total) concentrations. Carbon and nitrogen were analyzed using a LECO TruMac CN macro determinator with soils that were dried at 105°C overnight, stored in a desiccator, and then dried once more at 105°C two hours before analysis. These measurements were used to develop depth profiles of the soil geochemical parameters and differentiate between similar soil depth increments. Column Experiment Set Up A temperature-controlled column system was developed to monitor biogeochemical changes in soil porewater and associated greenhouse gas release during saturation and drainage events. Two separate experiments were conducted: thermokarst soil column (TC) and upland soil column (UC). The column consisted of a PVC tube (7.5 cm diameter, 60 cm long) with threaded ports (ORNL machine shop) for porewater sampling and sensor installation. A flange was attached to the base of the PVC tube, and a bottom plate with an outflow valve was bolted on the bottom. The bolts functioned as legs to support the column. A mesh screen was installed at the bottom of the column with 10 cm of sand overlying the screen to distribute outflow. After geochemical characterization of the upland and thermokarst cores with depth, similar depth increments were homogenized to create three distinct zones (organic, mineral/transition, and permafrost/deep) for both the upland and thermokarst cores. The homogenization step was necessary to evaluate biogeochemical changes in the soil pre- and post-experiment; without homogenizing, it would be challenging to differentiate heterogeneity in the soil profile from true changes in biogeochemistry that occurred during saturation and drainage. Homogenization was conducted in an anaerobic chamber filled with nitrogen and 1% hydrogen (COY Laboratories), with soil increments mixed by hand using a sterile spoon in sterile bags on top of ice packs to minimize soil warming. The PVC tube for the column experiments was packed with homogenized soil increments inside the glove bag starting at the base of the column (above the sand layer) with the permafrost/deep soil and moving upward through mineral/transition, and organic soil zones. Soil was added in “lifts” of 100-200 g of wet soil, with slight compaction after each lift using a sterile stainless-steel rod with a flanged end. During the packing phase, column ports were covered with parafilm. The packed soil column was sealed, removed from the anerobic glove bag, and stored at 4 °C in an environmental chamber until experiment initiation the following day. This process was completed separately for the thermokarst and upland soil experiments. The column temperature control, sensor installation, and saturation were completed two days prior to the initial experimental draining phase. The soil column was maintained at 4 °C by wrapping the packed PVC column in copper tubing connected to a circulating cooling unit (PolyScience) filled with an antifreeze solution. Three volumetric water content sensors (Teros 12, METER) were installed at depths of 2 cm, 15 cm, and 27 cm from the top of the soil column and secured in place using large zip ties. Calibration curves for volumetric water content were pre-determined for organic and mineral soils using the same setup with the sensors inserted through a “calibration column” at known volumetric water contents. Parafilm covering sampling ports was replaced with compression fittings threaded into the ports before wrapping the column and copper flow lines with black nitrile butadiene/ polyvinyl chloride insulation (0.5 inch thick). Optical oxygen sensors (Pyroscience, OXROB3), were inserted at depths of 1 cm, 8.5 cm, 18.5 cm, and 36 cm (from the top of the soil) after pre-piercing the soil with a comparable diameter sterile stainless-steel rod, and then securing with compression fittings. A similar approach was used to install Rhizon porewater samplers (Eijkelkamp) at depths of 2 cm, 12 cm, 22 cm, 32 cm, and 42 cm. Figure 9 details the soil column sensor locations. After sensor installation and two days before the initial column drainage, distilled, deionized water (Millipore) at 4 °C was used to raise the water level in the soil column to the soil air interface. Thermocouples were used to confirm internal soil temperatures at depths of 36 and 8.5 cm during the 24 hours following sensor installation and soil saturation. Column Experiment Operation and Sampling Column experiments were operated with a constant flow of 5 mL/min of air through the soil column headspace. The portion of headspace at the top of the capped soil column had an outlet port to allow continuous flow. Headspace gas mixing was modeled as a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with a constant inflow and outflow, and a source term was used to relate headspace gas concentrations to fluxes from the soil. The columns underwent three drainage-saturation phases during the experiment, and the TC and UC columns were evaluated for 94 days and 88 days, respectively. The initial draining phase began when the outflow port at the base of the column was opened. The first phase lasted approximately 35 days (32 days for UC and 37 days for TC), controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the thermokarst soil. Column effluent samples were collected and weighed to estimate the outflow rate over time. At the beginning of the second phase (the saturation phase), the outflow port was closed and distilled, deionized water was added over two hours to increase the water elevation in the soil column to the interface between the top of the soil column and the headspace gas. The top VWC sensor at 2 cm depth was used to confirm that the column stayed saturated. After approximately 20 days of saturation (21 days for UC and 19 days for TC), a second draining phase followed (28 days for US and 35 days for TC), again with effluent collection. Water levels in the soil column during the draining phases were controlled by gravity drainage, and the drainage rate was assumed to correlate with soil hydraulic conductivity. Headspace gas samples were taken every one to four days, and small volumes of porewater at five different depths were sampled approximately once per week. Pre-evacuated, 12 mLvials (Exetainer, Labco, High Wycombe, UK) were used for headspace gas sampling; 12 mL of soil column headspace gas was sampled through the headspace outflow port and immediately injected into an Exetainer vial. Samples were stored upside-down in a layer of water to prevent any losses prior to analysis by gas chromatography (described below). The same Exetainer vials were used to sample soil porewater by inserting a needle from the Rhizon sampling line directly into the Exetainer vial, and allowing the vacuum in the vials to remove approximately 1.5 mL of porewater over 5 to 10 minutes. Vials were massed before porewater extraction and after to estimate total volume of sample by mass. A subsample of each porewater sample (200 µL) was removed and immediately evaluated for ferrous and total iron as described above. After measuring headspace gas in the porewater sampling vial and taking another aliquot for further water analysis (300 µL), pH was measured in the porewater samples. Effluent water from the soil column was collected from the outflow sample port during draining phases in 20 mL glass vials. Effluent samples were passed through an Acrodisc syringe filter (0.8 µm prefilter with 0.2 µm filter, Pall Corp.) and stored at 4°C prior to analysis. Gas and Aqueous Sample Analyses Headspace gas samples from the soil column were analyzed using a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID) and methanizer (Shimadzu GC-2014) to determine carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The GC instrument was also equipped with TCD and ECD detectors to monitor other gases, including higher CO2 concentrations and nitrous oxide (N2O). An AOC-6000 autosampler (Shimadzu) was used to inject samples from the Exetainer vials into the inlet port and gases were separated on a HaySepD column (5 m by 0.125 inch, 80/100 mesh). Greenhouse gas concentrations, CO2 and CH4, were determined from linear regression of a five-point calibration curve using five separate mixed-gas standards. Concentrations were converted to fluxes based on the cross-sectional area of the column, the volume of headspace gas, and the flow rate of air through the headspace volume. Two different types of aqueous samples were collected during the experiments. Soil porewater samples from each Rhizon sampling port were collected with pre-evacuated Exetainer vials, and column effluent samples were collected from the outflow port at the column base during draining phases (Figure 9). Ferrous and total iron were analyzed in the porewater samples immediately after sampling using the 1,10-phenanthroline method described above. After measuring headspace gas (SRI GC-FID with methanizer) in the porewater sample vials and sub-sampling for anions and DOC, pH was measured with an InLab Micro pH combination electrode (Mettler Toledo). The remaining volume of the porewater sample was filtered (0.45 µm) and used to determine SUVA, measured using a Beckman DU 800 UV-Vis spectrophotometer in a quartz cuvette (Starna Cells). SUVA is the absorbance of a sample at 254 nm normalized by the DOC concentration. Samples from both the Rhizon sampling ports and the column effluent were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon with a TOC-L analyzer with ASI-L autosampler (Shimadzu). Samples were filtered (0.45 µm) and then acidified (1% HCl) before analysis. Aqueous samples from the sampling ports were also analyzed for anions using ion chromatography with a Integrion ion chromatograph equipped with a AS15 analytical and guard columns (Dionex), a hydroxide eluent generator, and a conductivity detector. Targeted anions included major anions (chloride, nitrate, phosphate, and sulfate) and a suite of organic acids (formic, acetic, propionic, oxalic, pyruvic, and citric). Due to the small sample size (300 µL) and dilution required for analysis, limited information was available for the organic acids measured, as many were near the detection limit for this method. Soil Composition Analysis Soil carbon and nitrogen compositions were determined pre and post experiment for five different depths for both TC and UC experiments using a LECO TruMac CN or an Elementar Unicube. Samples were air-dried, ground with a mortar and pestle, and sieved (No. 200 sieve). Samples were then placed in an oven (105 °C) overnight, stored in a desiccator, and then dried once more at 105 °C two hours before analysis. LECO soil standards were used to quantify carbon and nitrogen percentages in soil samples. The soil iron extraction protocol was informed by previous studies, and targeted water extractable, exchangeable, organic-bound, poorly crystalline, and crystalline iron. Each extraction used 10 mL of extraction solution and 1 g of soil and were extracted in an anaerobic chamber (COY Laboratories). Details for each sequential extraction step are included below. Except for the crystalline extractions that were only conducted for one replicate, all other extractions were conducted in triplicate. After each extraction step, soil slurries were centrifuged at 4000 rpm (~3000 g) for 30 minutes and filtered through 0.45 µm syringe filter. The filtrate was reacted with a FerroVer iron assay (HACH 8008), and the absorbance was measured on a Beckman DU800 at 510 nm. Blanks were included for both the extraction solution and the extraction solution plus the FerroVer reagent to account for background absorbance due to the extraction solutions. The extraction solution for the water-extractable iron included anoxic water degassed with nitrogen and shaken for 90 minutes before analysis. Excess extraction solution from this step was used for water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) analysis. The second, sequential extraction solution for exchangeable iron was a barium ammonium chloride solution (0.1 M BaCl2-NH4Cl) degassed with nitrogen and shaken for 20 minutes before analysis. In the third extraction, organic-bound iron was extracted with sodium pyrophosphate (0.1 M Na4P2O7 pH 10) with shaking for 16 hours. In the fourth extraction, poorly crystalline iron was extracted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride (0.25 M NH2OH•HCl pH 2) with shaking for 48 hours. In the final extraction, which was only completed for one sample at each depth, crystalline iron oxides were extracted with a bicarbonate-citrate-dithionite solution (0.11 M NaHCO3 + 0.1 M Na2S2O4 + 0.27 M Na3C6H5O) with shaking for 16 hours2,7. Data for extractions was reported as mass of iron extracted per gram of soil.

To determine surface-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane under anticipated end-of-century warming, we used heating rods to warm soil (by 3.8 °C) to the depth of permafrost in polygonal tundra over two growing seasons at the Barrow Environmental Observatory in Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska. This data product includes supporting data for the companion paper entitled ""Large emissions of CO2 and CH4 due to active-layer warming in Arctic tundra"", published in Nature Communications by Torn et al. This data package contains seven data files in csv format with corresponding data dictionaries and file-level metadata, describing vegetation biomass dry weight (""Utqiagvik_Vegetation_Biomass_2014.csv""), radiocarbon measurements of respired carbon dioxide (""Utqiagvik_Radiocarbon_2015_2016.csv""), surface-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane and associated soil temperature (""Utqiagvik_Fluxes_Temperature_2015_2016.csv""), and soil temperature measurements averaged every 15-min and 1-hr for 2015 and 2016 (""Utqiagvik_Temperature_15min_2015.csv"", ""Utqiagvik_Temperature_15min_2016.csv"", ""Utqiagvik_Temperature_1hr_2015.csv"", ""Utqiagvik_Temperature_1hr_2016.csv""). There are no specific software requirements to use these data. UIC Science Native Corporation facilitated our scientific research on the Barrow Environmental Observatory, which is Iñupiat land. The Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments: Arctic (NGEE Arctic), was a research effort to reduce uncertainty in Earth System Models by developing a predictive understanding of carbon-rich Arctic ecosystems and feedbacks to climate. NGEE Arctic was supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska. Through observations, experiments, and synthesis with existing datasets, NGEE Arctic provided an enhanced knowledge base for multi-scale modeling and contributed to improved process representation at global pan-Arctic scales within the Department of Energy's Earth system Model (the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, or E3SM), and specifically within the E3SM Land Model component (ELM)."	Utqiagvik Micro-Warming Experiment Site	"Please see methods in ""Large emissions of CO2 and CH4 due to active-layer warming in Arctic tundra"" for full descriptions, associated figures, and citations. Site Description The experiment was located in high-centered ice-wedge polygons at the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) near Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska (71.3°N, 156.5°W). Historic (1901–2007) Utqiaġvik mean annual temperature is -12°C and mean annual precipitation is 113.5 mm with a short snow-free summer from June through September. Soils are Cyrosols (Gelisols) that are mostly Typic Aquiturbels, Typic Histoturbels, and Typic Aquorthels. Continuous ice-rich permafrost underlies an active layer of 20-60 cm thickness depending on location across the BEO and year. The ice-wedge polygons are discrete landscape units formed from freezing and thawing processes. The high portions of the individual flat- or high-centered polygons, roughly 10 m in diameter and separated by low-lying wet or inundated troughs, had dry, aerobic surface soils and sparse vegetation dominated by Luzula Arctica, Vaccinium vitis idaea, several moss and lichen species, as well as Eriophorum vaginatum, Petasites frigidus, Salix rotundifolia and other high arctic tundra species. Experiment layout and pretreatment measurements Four blocks were established in the center of four different polygons of roughly equal active layer depth. On August 24, 2014, we installed two 25 cm diameter mesocosms in each polygon (block) for control and treatment plots. Each mesocosm was created by inserting a 45 cm tall PVC tube (open on top and bottom) vertically in the soil to span the full active layer depth at these sites (32-44 cm measured with a thaw-depth probe adjacent to the plots in 2015-16); each plot was delineated by the 25 cm diameter PVC ring which also isolated the mesocosm soil profile from the surrounding soil. A thicker PVC collar was glued to the top of mesocosm’s PVC column. The collar had a 3 cm deep trench made to seat the CO2 flux chamber; during measurement, the trench was filled with water to make an airtight seal with the chamber. The mesocosms were installed the year before the manipulation, to avoid disturbance effects and allow a year of pretreatment fluxes. There was no significant difference between control and pre-heated plots in CO2 respiration or microbial biomass; aboveground plant biomass was measured near the plots (next section). As part of an earlier study, this site had received a one-time 13C-labeled glucose amendment in 2014 equivalent to 0.1% of the SOC in the top 10 cm, but this carbon addition had no detectable effect on the metrics assessed in this experiment. For example, the glucose amendment had no detectable effect on ecosystem respiration (P<0.12) measured 13 times in 2014 and spring 2015 or soil microbial biomass (P < 0.11) measured in fall 2014; we also confirmed that there was also no delayed effect of the amendment in 2016 by monitoring two additional amended polygons outside the heating experiment. We note, however, that residual 13C-CO2 was detected in 2015 with Keeling plots (Keeling, 1958) in low-glucose-addition plots (glucose addition plots: mean delta 13C = 8.55 per mil, standard deviation=25.5 per mil, n=8. Control plots: mean delta 13C = -23.9 per mil, standard deviation = 9.97 per mil, n=40) . The number of replicate blocks was four in the first year (2015) and first half of 2016 and was reduced to three blocks mid-way through the second year (2016) due to malfunctions in the custom chips controlling the heating and temperature measurements. Site characterization: soil carbon, microbial biomass, vegetation biomass We harvested aboveground vegetation in August 2014 from one 25 cm diameter circle per polygon, near the mesocosms. Vegetation was sorted immediately into vascular and nonvascular (moss + lichen) components, oven dried at 60 °C, and weighed. Live-root biomass, determined in other BEO polygons (for Carex aquatilis, Eriophorum angustifolium, and Salix rotundifolia) is concentrated in the top 25 cm 58. Soils were sampled from adjacent replicate plots on September 8 and 20, 2014 for analysis of organic carbon and nitrogen content and microbial biomass carbon determined by elemental analysis and chloroform fumigation extraction, respectively. Warming Manipulation In June 2015, a 60 cm long vertical rod was installed in the center of each heated and control mesocosm (PVC tube). Heater cable in the rod extended 50 cm below the surface. We used a nickel-chrome heating element (Thermosoft Ultra Flexible Cable Heater; www.Thermosoft.net, IT0403-12: 12V, 1.0A, 12WT for 4 ft cable) run in a loop. Resistance was 0.5 ohm per cm for single wire; 1 ohm per cm for the loop. We used KONA 870FT-LV-DP heat-conductive epoxy cement to pot the heater cables in ¼ inch diameter, 0.035 inch wall, 1/8 hard seamless 316 stainless steel tubes. An insulated crimp connector at the bottom of the heater made the electrical turnaround inside the rod. Disturbance-control rods were constructed in the same way but without heater wire and installed into control plots. The temperature probes and heating rods were installed by drilling a pilot hole (1.5 – 3.5 mm larger in diameter than the probe or rod), into the frozen permafrost (using a cordless rotary hammer drill (Bosch 36V Li-Ion) and custom-length drill bits) and then inserting the probe or rod to the desired depth. Temperature monitoring and heating regulation Three temperature probes were inserted into each plot, at 6, 8, and 10 cm from the center of the plot (where the heating or disturbance-control rod was). The custom-made probes contained five thermistors between 5-50 cm depth. The thermistors were glued along a nylon strip that was inserted into a butyrate tube, and the tube was filled with urethane. An improved version is documented in Leger et al. 2019. Temperature and heating status (on/off) were logged and saved every 3 seconds in 2015 as we evaluated the system, and every 30 seconds in 2016 until mid-June and then at 5-minute intervals for the rest of the season to save on memory. The probes at 8 cm distance from center (hereafter regulator probes) were used to control the heating. At each timepoint, if the depth-averaged temperature difference between regulator probes in a heated and unheated plot pair was <4ºC, the heater was turned on until the next measurement time point (e.g., 3 sec) and reevaluated. If the temperature difference was >= 4ºC, the heating rod received no power. The temperature readings were aggregated to one- or two-hour averages for plots and analysis. The single vertical heating rod was able to warm the whole active layer and maintain the target temperature difference. We maintained a temperature difference of 4.0 ºC based on sensors averaged over 10, 20, and 35 cm depths, and 3.8 ºC median over all depths. The amount of warming at 5 cm depth was more variable and rarely reached 4ºC because of rainfall and heat exchange with the atmosphere. Peak active-layer depth averaged <50 cm in unheated soil, based on thaw depth probes and temperature sensors; in the absence of heating, 50 cm temperatures were <0ºC. Heating brought the 50 cm temperature above 0ºC, indicating thaw of frozen ground and a deeper active layer. The temperature difference at 50 cm between treatments was less than 4ºC because energy was consumed by the phase change of thawing water in permafrost and energy could be advected by lateral flow of the newly thawed water. For these reasons, average warming of the whole profile over all depths and plot area (all probes) was always lower than the set target of 4ºC. The infrastructure was adequate to heat the soils several degrees warmer if desired, however, by adjusting the heater settings. Power From June 27 to August 11, 2015, the heaters, temperature probes, and dataloggers were powered by two 12V 110 amp-hour marine batteries. Drained batteries were swapped manually for charged units; thus, heating occurred only when the research team was in Utqiaġvik. After August 12, 2015, power was supplied by photovoltaic panels and the experiment operated nearly continuously during the growing season. For each block, two 123 W panels (Sharp ND-123UJF; 662×1499 mm) were connected to a charge controller to maintain charge on the batteries. The panels were mounted to a Unistrut frame anchored to permafrost, facing south at a ~70° angle to the horizontal. To minimize power requirements, custom-made circuit boards controlled the warming and logged the data. Each board sampled and digitized 16 analog thermistor channels with a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADS1243). Data were streamed via RS232/RS485 and WiFi as well as stored locally on three 1Gbit NAND flash chips. A low power Microchip microcontroller (PIC18F97J60) contained the firmware to control data acquisition, storage, communication, and control of the heater circuit. If a controller system malfunctioned, data from that block were not used for the time period that the heating or temperature monitoring were not operational. The interface for setup of system properties, deployment, and data downloading was initially via a custom iOS App running on an iPad. This was upgraded to a Gumstix Overo embedded Linux module and a Node.js web application to allow for a simplified interface and connection to a WiFi or wired network. Carbon Fluxes and Flux Isotopes Surface fluxes of CO2 and CH4 Surface fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were measured using chambers 25 cm in diameter, vented to minimize pressure excursions due to the Venturi effect 59, circulating through a Los Gatos Research, Inc. (LGR) Ultra-Portable Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (915-0011). We used opaque chambers to measure ecosystem respiration (surface respiration or Reco) and CH4 flux. We monitored headspace concentrations for 3-7 minutes and calculated the flux rate from the linear region of the concentration vs. time curve. Immediately prior to measuring respiration on some days, we measured fluxes with a clear chamber, to estimate net ecosystem exchange (NEE) using the first 60 seconds of each measurement; after 60 seconds the drawdown rate decreased, possibly due to the drawdown of CO2 mixing ratios in the chamber or to fogging due to evapotranspiration. Flux measurements were measured before (2014, 2015) and during heating treatments in 2015 and 2016. Radiocarbon (14C) of soil respiration On August 5 and 30 in 2015 and May 23 and June 12, 2016, we collected CO2 from non-vented soil chambers for radiocarbon analysis. Samples were collected when the heaters were on. Briefly, after circulating chamber gas through soda lime for 20 minutes to remove CO2, we allowed CO2 to accumulate over 2 to 24 hours, depending on the CO2 flux rate. Prior to sampling, we measured the CO2 concentration in the chamber by passing 30 mL of gas through a LI-820 CO2 gas analyzer (LI-COR, Inc.). Samples were collected in one or more 500-1000 mL evacuated stainless steel canisters connected to chamber sampling ports via capillary tubing. For atmospheric radiocarbon values we collected local air samples in 3000 mL stainless steel canisters on August 30, 2015 and May 25, 2016. The CO2 from gas samples was cryogenically purified under vacuum, split for 14C and 13C analysis, and sealed in 6 mm quartz tubes at Berkeley Lab. Samples were analyzed at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, where CO2 was reduced to graphite on iron powder under H248 and 14C abundance measured using a HVEC FN Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator mass spectrometer. 13C/12C was analyzed on the UC Davis Stable Isotope Laboratory GVI Optima Stable Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer. Radiocarbon content Δ14C is reported as fraction of the modern NBS Oxalic Acid I (OX1) standard (F14C), and as deviations in parts per thousand (‰) from the absolute (decay-corrected) OX1 standard (Δ14C), following Stuiver and Polach (1977). Values have been corrected for mass-dependent isotopic fractionation using 13C measurements of the splits. We corrected surface chamber radiocarbon measurements for atmospheric contamination (e.g., residual atmospheric air in the chamber headspace after scrubbing) using a previously published method. In 2015 and 2016, Δ14Catm = 15.1‰ and 10.1‰ respectively. These values were consistent with the Arctic atmospheric radiocarbon record and its recent 2-3‰ annual decrease 61, with BEO values in the three preceding years of 22.2‰ (2012), 19.3‰ (2013), and 17.8‰ (2014). The δ13C of respiration (-24.41‰) was estimated as the minimum value (i.e., least atmospheric contamination) of the 12 plot measurements."

As meteorological forcings varied across the watershed, a high-frequency database is needed to ensure consistency in the data analysis and modeling. We evaluated several data sources, including gridded meteorological products and field data from meteorological stations. We determined that our modeling efforts required multiple data sources to meet all their needs. As output, this dataset contains (c) a single CSV data file (*_1981-2022.csv) for each location (20 CSV output files total) containing hourly time series data for 1981 to 2022 and (d) five PNG files of time series and density plots for each variable per location (100 PNG files). Detailed location metadata is contained within the Integrated_Met_Database_Locations.csv file for each point location included within this dataset, obtained from Varadharajan et al., 2023 doi:10.15485/1660962. This dataset also includes (e) a file-level metadata (flmd.csv) file that lists each file contained in the dataset with associated metadata and (f) a data dictionary (dd.csv) file that contains column/row headers used throughout the files along with a definition, units, and data type. Review the (g) ReadMe_Integrated_Met_Database.pdf file for additional details on the script, methods, and structure of the dataset. The script integrates Northwest Alliance for Computational Science and Engineering’s PRISM gridded data product, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis 1 gridded data product (through the `RCNEP` R package, Kemp et al., doi:10.32614/CRAN.package.RNCEP), and analytical-based calculations. Further, this script downscales the input data into hourly frequency, which is necessary for the modeling efforts.	The East River (ER) is a snow‐dominated, headwater basin of the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) located in the western United States. The ER is the designated testbed of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area (WFSFA). Through WFSFA, observational networks have been established to measure stream discharge and precipitation chemistry. The ER is considered representative of many snow‐dominated headwaters of the Rocky Mountains. The study domain encompasses nearly 85 square km, a 1.4‐km vertical drop in elevation (4,120 to 2,760 m) and pristine alpine, subalpine, montane, and riparian ecosystems. The ER contains high‐energy mountain streams to low‐energy meandering floodplains and is eroding primarily into the Cretaceous, carbon‐rich, marine shale of the Mancos Formation. Additional metadata on specific locations within the watershed are provided in the following related data package: Varadharajan C. et al. (2023) doi:10.15485/1660962	The air temperature (Ta_oC) and precipitation (Precip_mm_d) variables were downscaled from daily to hourly frequency from the PRISM data source. The windspeed (WS_m_s) variable was calculated from the u- and v-wind components and downscaled from 6-hourly frequency data from Reanalysis. The relative humidity (RH_pct) variable similarly posed challenges, as the Reanalysis data source seemed untrustworthy. Therefore, relative humidity values were calculated using an analytical formula that considered due point and mean temperatures. The solar radiation (SR_W_m2) variable posed significant challenges, as downscaling from the 6-hourly Reanalysis data source resulted in inaccurate time series data. Therefore, daily solar radiation curves were calculated using the maximum value for a given day (from Reanalysis data) and sunrise, sunset, and solar noon times based on the site's geographical location (latitude and longitude). During the downscaling of daily or 6-hourly data to hourly data frequency, any negative values for precipitation and solar radiation were adjusted to be a value of “0”. 4 km-resolution PRISM data was obtained for all point locations via the PRISM data explorer (https://prism.oregonstate.edu/explorer/). Coordinates for locations were obtained from Varadharajan et al., 2023 doi:10.15485/1660962. All variables from PRISM were downloaded in a daily frequency from 1981-01-01 to 2022-12-31. The interpolate option for PRISM data was selected for the point locations. NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis 1 gridded data was obtained through the `RCNEP` R package (Kemp et al., doi:10.32614/CRAN.package.RNCEP) for each point location and was downloaded for 1981-01-01 to 2022-12-31. For Solar Radiation data, downward solar radiation (dswrf.sfc, ‘gaussian’) was downloaded and calculated, based on methods described in the ReadMe_Integrated_Met_Database.pdf. Wind components (uwnd.sig995 and vwnd,sig995, ‘surface’) were downloaded and windspeed was calculated based on methods described in ReadMe_Integrated_Met_Database.pdf.

The RC SFA works to transform understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics in river corridor hydrobiogeochemical functions from molecular reaction to watershed and basin scales. The knowledge we gain is used to formulate and test hypotheses and to improve mechanistic representation of river corridor processes and their response to disturbances in multiscale models of integrated hydrobiogeochemical function. The data provided includes Site ID, latitude, longitude, stream name, and common ID (COMID) for sites used across the RC SFA. The COMID can be used to find and download data from NHDPlus (https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/nhdplus-national-hydrography-dataset-plus) and other platforms. The sites included are non-exhaustive. Sites (including past sites) will be added to this data package in the future. Data generated from the RC SFA can be accessed at https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/portals/PNNLRiverCorridorSFA. This dataset is comprised of one main data folder. The data folder consists of (1) file-level metadata; (2) data dictionary; (3) readme; (4) methods codes; (5) geospatial information for all RC SFA sites including International Generic Sample Number (IGSN); (6) maps of all sites and sites in Washington State, USA; and (7) a subfolder with the shapefile of all sites. All files are .csv, .pdf, .shp, .cpg, .dbf, .prj, .qmd, or .shx. This data package was originally published in April 2023. It was updated in June 2023 (v2; modified files), December 2023 (v3; modified files), and January 2025 (v4; modified files). See the change history section in the readme for more details.	BLU-BLU, Blue River, United States	Locations for each site were collected by field teams using a variety of GPS technologies. Each site's location was matched with the nearest NHDPlus Version 2 (NHDPlusV2) network streamline using the NNJoin nearest-neighbor spatial join plugin (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/NNJoin/) for QGIS (QGIS Geographic Information System. QGIS Association. http://www.qgis.org). Stream lines are identified in NHDPlusV2 by a unique common-ID or COMID. The COMID identified by the nearest-neighbor spatial join is referred to here as the raw COMID. Join results (raw COMIDs) were manually reviewed by personnel familiar with the sites. One key review criterion was whether or not the stream name from the site metadata matched the stream name from NHDPlusV2. In situations where the nearest-neighbor spatial join did not identify the correct stream, the correct stream line was manually identified (if possible), and a rectified COMID was extracted. Approach to change history and versioning: Updates to data package version: When any file within a data package is updated, the data package version number is updated. The data package version number is indicated in the title of the data package, the data package folder name, and in the change history table below. You can access previous versions of the data package by sending a request to ESS-DIVE. Updates to individual file versions: As files are changed, the file version number is also updated. The file version number is indicated in the file name, file level metadata (flmd) file, and the change history table below. The version number on an individual file may not match the version number of the data package. For example, v3 of a data package may include v2 of an individual file.

doi:10.15485/2507189	ess-dive-017418f3effd0e8-20250127T090951536	Shrub Expansion Simulations at Trail Valley Creek Tundra site using E3SM Land Model (ELM) Arctic-focused Version	active layer|carbon|earth science|frozen ground|land surface|permafrost|soil moisture/water content|soil respiration|soils	The warming of the Arctic is causing substantial compositional, structural, and functional changes in tundra vegetation including shrub and densification in parts of the Arctic. Assessing the impact of these changes in vegetation composition on the Arctic’s carbon and energy budgets is important to constrain projected local and global surface-atmosphere exchanges. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of the projected surface energy fluxes, soil carbon pools, and carbon dioxide fluxes (net ecosystem exchange, gross primary production, and ecosystem respiration) between present day and 2100 to different shrub expansion rates and air temperature increases under future emission scenarios (intermediate – RCP4.5, and high – RCP8.5) using the Arctic-focused version of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM). We focus on Trail Valley Creek (TVC), a mineral upland tundra site located in the western Canadian Arctic, which is experiencing tall shrub densification and expansion. In this study, we run TVC under two different warming scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 and simulate different shrubification rates projected until year 2100. In this repository, we include all the forcing, input, parameters, and output data corresponding to all the simulations performed. flmd.csv includes a detailed description of the datasets files.	Trail Valley Creek is located around 45 km north of Inuvik, NT within the EPA Level II Ecoregion. It is a tundra site including dwarf shrubs such as birch, alder shrubs, and willows, as well as grasses and tussocks, and patches of lichen and mosses	ELM arctic-focused version was employed to simulate carbon dioxide and water fluxes for TVC, using climate forcing data from the NA-CORDEX dataset (McGinnis & Mearns, 2021). This dataset is based on outputs from regional climate model simulations conducted under the North American branch of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (NA-CORDEX), an international effort to downscale global simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive. The forcing data were derived from 33 bias-corrected GCM-RCM combinations for North America, run under fully transient conditions. The historical period covered 1950–2005, while future projections utilized RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 for the years 2006–2100, with spatial resolutions of 0.22° and 0.44°. To minimize the influence of climate model biases on simulation results, the forcing data were adjusted to match the statistical properties of observed meteorological data for the overlapping 1992–2022 period, using the methods described by Cannon (2018) and Cannon et al. (2022) The spin-up process consisted of two phases: an initial 200-year accelerated spin-up to allow soil and above-ground vegetation carbon to accumulate and reach equilibrium, followed by a standard spin-up lasting 600 years using normal decomposition parameters (Yuan et al., 2021). Transient simulations were then conducted for the period from 1850 to 2100. The prescribed vegetation-cover distribution in TVC was: 40% lichen, 30% deciduous dwarf shrub, and 30% tussock. Six shrubification scenarios were considered, prescribed as an annual relative increase to the tall shrub PFT area fraction, starting at 2022 and continuing until 2100, resulting in an exponential increase in the relative cover of the shrub PFT: S1: Keep shrub distribution constant till 2100 (0% shrubification). S2: Increase shrub cover by 0.1% y-1; Shrubs equally replace both lichens and tussock. S3: Increase shrub cover by 0.5% y-1; Shrubs equally replace both lichens and tussock. S4: Increase shrub cover by 0.5% y-1; Shrubs replace only lichens. S5: Increase shrub cover by 0.5% y-1; Shrubs replace only tussock. S6: Increase shrub cover by 1% y-1; Shrubs equally replace both lichens and tussock. By 2100, the 0.1% y-1 shrubification rate (S2) would result in 36.5 % shrub area, the 0.5 % y-1 shrubification rate (S3, S4, and S5) would result in 44.5 % shrub area, and the 1 % y-1 shrubification rate (S6) would result in 65.8 % shrub area.

Measurements of carbon fractions from enclosure drainage outflows are also included. Porewater profiles were collected up to four times annually from 2014 to 2020 with a piezometer and outflow samples were collected up to eight times annually in 2016 and 2017. Porewater organic and inorganic fractions were measured using a Finnigan Mat Delta V Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer and a Shimadzu Total Organic Carbon. Radiocarbon analyses were conducted at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The peat soils were subjected to deep peat heating (DPH) beginning in June of 2014 followed by whole ecosystem warming (WEW) in August of 2015 (Hanson et al. 2017). The experimental work was conducted in a Picea mariana [black spruce] – Sphagnum spp. bog forest in northern Minnesota, 40 km north of Grand Rapids, in the USDA Forest Service Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF). These changes in these inorganic and organic carbon fractions in response to whole ecosystem warming may alter decomposition and microbial communities, as well as overall soil carbon storage.	SPRUCE Experiment Site	Study Site: Observations occurred at The Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s SPRUCE (Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments) project (Hanson et al., 2017) at S1 bog at the U.S. Forest Service’s Marcell Experimental Forest, in Minnesota, USA (47°30.476’ N; 93°27.162’ W). SPRUCE is an ecosystem-scale study that warms the vegetation and peatland soil profile to a depth of 2 m within 12.8-m diameter open-top enclosures. The peat was heated first at – 2 m for a period of 1 year starting in summer 2014 (deep peat heating phase), then heating of the overlying air began in August 2015 starting the whole ecosystem warming phase of the experiment. Sample Collection: Porewater was collected from a set of piezometers located within each treatment enclosure and at the unheated control location up to four times annually from June 2014 through August 2020. Each piezometer consists of a 2.5 cm diameter PVC (poly vinyl chloride) pipe with a screen mesh bottom installed to specified depths below the peat hollow surface: 25 cm, 50 cm, 75 cm, 100 cm, 150 cm, and 200 cm. Porewater was collected from piezometers using a peristaltic pump attached to a syringe. Surface water samples were collected at 10 cm using perforated stainless-steel tubes that were inserted into the peat to 10 cm or the top of the water table, whichever was shallowest. Porewater samples were measured for dissolve organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations, as well as stable 13C and radiocarbon (14C) isotopic composition. Additionally, each enclosure has an outlet that allows water to passive lateral drainage from the top 25 cm, which to mimic near-surface drainage that dominates the annual movement of water to the outlet. Collections were also made from a weir draining the whole bog to serve as a control. We measured DIC concentrations and 13C isotopes in porewater collected from each of these “outflows” monthly from June-December of 2016, and March-November of 2017, when there was flow. We also collected outflow water and here report DOC concentrations for August in each year from 2016-2019. Laboratory Methods Water samples were immediately injected into septum-sealed evacuated glass vials. A 1 mL aliquot of 10% phosphoric acid was added to each vial to preserve the samples and ensure that all DIC was in the form of dissolved CO2 (i.e., not bicarbonate or carbonate). Porewater CO2 and CH4 concentrations and isotopes were analyzed a Finnigan Mat Delta V Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer coupled to a gas chromatograph. The analytical uncertainty based on repeated measurements of a standard was <0.15‰ for δ13CO2 and δ13CH4 and <5% for CO2 and CH4 concentrations. CO2 and CH4 were cryogenically separated. The CO2 was then flame-sealed in a 6 mm Pyrex tube using a vacuum line. The CH4 was converted to CO2 via combustion at 580 °C for 18 h, followed by cryogenic purification and then was flame sealed in a 6 mm Pyrex tube under vacuum. The 6 mm tubes for Δ14C analysis were sent to the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility (NOSAMS) and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). All radiocarbon values were corrected for biological mass-dependent fractionation using δ13C. Following gas analysis, the concentration of DOC in porewater samples was measured by high-temperature catalytic oxidation using a Shimadzu Total Organic Carbon analyzer equipped with a non-dispersive infrared detector. Samples were analyzed in triplicate with a coefficient of variance <2%. To prepare samples for DOC radiocarbon (14C) analysis, the porewater was freeze-dried in pre-combusted 9 mm Pyrex tubes. Oxidizing agents, cupric oxide, copper shots and silver, were added to each tube which was then evacuated and flame sealed. To convert the organic C to CO2, the sealed tubes were combusted at 580 °C for 18 h. The resulting CO2 was purified cryogenically and sealed into 6 mm Pyrex tubes. Sample were sent to NOSAMS and LLNL for 14C analyses. All radiocarbon values were corrected for biological mass dependent fractionation using the δ13C. Additional methodology details can be found in Wilson et al., 2021.

The magnetic data were collected using a Geometrics Inc. G-858 gradiometer and G-857 base station in 2018 and the G-864 gradiometer and G857 base station in 2023. The data was collected (in all instances) by towing the gradiometer behind a snow machine around the watershed with the two sensors in a vertical profile with constant spacing during the continuous survey in that specific year. Magnetic total field measurements were collected by gradiometer and base station, and the data processing was performed in Geometrics MagMap2000 software. The processing steps were limited to removal of data spikes (despiking), reading dropouts, and correction/removal of bad GPS points. All offsets between sensors and GPS are stated within the data files and metadata, alongwith the processed and raw data. The Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments: Arctic (NGEE Arctic), was a research effort to reduce uncertainty in Earth System Models by developing a predictive understanding of carbon-rich Arctic ecosystems and feedbacks to climate. NGEE Arctic was supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska. Through observations, experiments, and synthesis with existing datasets, NGEE Arctic provided an enhanced knowledge base for multi-scale modeling and contributed to improved process representation at global pan-Arctic scales within the Department of Energy's Earth system Model (the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, or E3SM), and specifically within the E3SM Land Model component (ELM). In this data submission there are two sets of raw magnetic data (.bin and .stn for 2018 and base for 2023; raw rover mag for 2023 is in .csv) inside two .zip files that identify the year the mag data was collected. The data are proprietary format to Geometrics and can be opened and processed with MagMap2000 which can be downloaded for free at Geometrics website. There are also two processed data files *.csv for each year and two metadata files *.csv.	NGEE Arctic Teller Site, Mile Marker 47, Alaska.	Data acquisition and processing In March of 2018 and April 2023 subsurface magnetic data were collected across the NGEE Teller 27 watershed site using a Geometrics Inc. G-858 gradiometer and G-856/7 base station. Data was collected during the winter months which permitted access to the watershed via snow machine in order to data quickly and densely across the 2km by 2 km watershed. The base station was set in a fixed location to collect diurnal magnetic field fluctuations for later post processing. The gradiometer was pulled behind a snow machine on a custom built plastic and fiberglass non-metallic sled. The GPS was mounted on the snow machine to avoid interference with the magnetometer. To evaluate the influence of the snow machine and gps on the magnetic response a walk-away test was performed prior to the construction of the sled. This allowed for the right number of fiberglass tubes (1.524 m lengths) to be positioned between the snow machine and the magnetometer sled to avoid interference (~2.5 - 3 m). Plastic bolts were used to assemble the sled and sled tounge. Once the sled was assembled the gradiometer (2 mag sensors) were mounted vertically in the sled with sensor 1 on the bottom and 2 on the top. The spacings between these sensors during the performance of each survey is listed in the metadata file. The gps fed into the magnetometer used a real-time DGPS WAAS correction and was nominally +/- 1m. Magnetometer data post processing was performed in Geometrics MagMap2000 software. Data with bad GPS location points were either interpolated or removed depending if interpolation could be performed successfully. After all GPS points were corrected or removed, magnetometer data were evaluated for drop-outs and spikes, followed by a despiking routine. During collection tie-lines and loops (going back over the same location at a later time) were collected in order to assess instrument drift and corrected if needed. After this process, the data were exported for visualization.

Dissolved organic carbon concentrations collected from TOC are also provided in a similar format but are composited samples from hourly microdialysis collection. This provided resolution of diel rhizosphere dynamics belowground. Plant physiological data was also collected at every 5 min for 24 hr cycles in order to capture diel dynamics aboveground. This data was used to parameterize the reaction transport model eSTOMP-ROOTS, which examines the rhizosphere biogeochemistry of a growing Vicia faba plant. The aim was to investigate plant activity and belowground biogeochemical processes, particularly their impact on mineral-organic associations in the rhizosphere. We combined in-situ rhizosphere microsensor and plant physiological measurements with a 3-D plant-soil reactive transport model to explore the behavior of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the rhizosphere. Over several days, microdialysis probes placed at the root-soil interface in live soil showed distinct daily patterns of DOC concentration in the pore water. Spikes in DOC concentrations during the day aligned with peaks in leaf-level photosynthesis, accompanied by decreasing redox potential and dissolved oxygen levels, and increasing pH in the rhizosphere. This new mechanistic modeling framework, which integrates aboveground plant physiological data with non-destructive, high-resolution monitoring of rhizosphere processes, offers significant potential for studying the factors that control carbon storage in soils.	A fertile grassland soil classified as fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls was collected at a 15 cm depth at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (Gothic, CO).	Soils were brought to 40% water holding capacity using tap water and packed into the rhizobox to achieve field bulk density (1.5 g cm 3). A single V. faba (Windsour variety) seedling with a tap root of ~3 cm length was transferred into the rhizobox. Soil moisture was maintained using a cotton wick connected to an amber glass flask containing tap water placed along the side of the rhizobox. The polycarbonate portions of the rhizobox were covered with aluminum foil to limit light exposure, leaving the top open for the plant to grow, and placed in a rack where it was held at a 30◦ angle to facilitate plant root growth along the sensor array. Rhizoboxes were maintained in a growth chamber set to 16 h light and 8 h dark cycle with a maximum of 500 μmol photons m 2 s 1 at 20% humidity for light hour settings and 25 ◦C. light cycle temperature and 15 ◦C dark cycle temperature. Plants entered the second nodal stage by the time their roots arrived at sensor array within the rhizoboxes. Microelectrodes for pH, EH, and DO concentration measurements were installed along the side port along which single roots were channeled and were constructed in-house within 1/16” PEEKTM tubing. pH microelectrodes were designed with modifications from Perley (1939). These were calibrated versus a Saturated Calomel Electrode or solid-state Ag/AgCl electrode in pH buffers. Microprobe redox electrodes were built following previous reporting in Vepraskas (2002) with modifications to fit the rhizobox side ports. Changes in DO were monitored using solid Hg/Au voltametric microelectrodes. Hg/Au microelectrodes were constructed as previously reported in the literature (Luther et al., 2008) and used with stationary Ag/AgCl reference and platinum (Pt) counter electrodes. All measurements were made with a DLK-70 potentiostat (Analytical Instruments Systems, Ringoes, NJ) laboratory electrochemical analyzer which communicated via standard web browser on a laboratory laptop positioned outside of the growth chamber with connector cables extending outside from the analyzer to the micro-electrodes inside the rhizobox within the growth chamber. DO was quantified by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), between 0.1 and 1.9 V at a scan rate of 100 mV s 1 with 10s of deposition at 0.1 V. For DO, a two-point calibration was conducted using oxygen-saturated NaCl saline (20 mM) water (100% saturation) and a deoxygenated NaCl saline (20 mM) water (0% saturation). To maintain reproducibility during analysis, the Au/Hg amalgam electrodes ran cyclic voltammetry before each LSV scan. The redox and pH probes were similarly maintained by running initial scans before collecting stable final data points at each time step in the experiments. Along the interior wall of each individual rhizobox, a 10 mm long microdialysis probe (CMA 20 Harvard Apparatus) was installed. The positioning of the microdialysis probe allowed continuous measurements of the root-soil interface along individual roots. Because the soft original tubing for the microdialysis was noticeably leaking DOC, the original soft tubing. Rhizobox and associated microsensor setup. Magnified panel shows microsensor array containing microelectrodes controlled by the potentiostat as well as microdialysis probe connected to water pump and fraction collector. Rhizboxes are tilted at an angle of 30◦ degrees to facilitate root growth over the microsensor array. Detailed rhizobox design and dimensions included found in publication referenced in this report. Conceptualization of the biogeochemical reactions included in the numerical model to capture the measured diel dynamics in the rhizosphere. Rhizosphere biogeochemical parameters directly measured using microsensors are shown in white. Specific reactions incorporated into multicomponent reaction transport model (i.e., eSTOMP) are shown in yellow. We assumed that, during light periods (daytime), photosynthetic and transpiration activity are at their highest, causing high water uptake and exudation rates at the root-soil surface. Root exudates would increase DOC concentrations, with DOC being subject to microbial consumption (via respiration) and sorption to minerals. Microbial consumption of DOC was expected to lead to declines in DO and thus EH. Declines in EH and DO were assumed to lead to declines in aerobic respiration and relative to anaerobic respiration (Fe(III) oxide reduction). We anticipated that Fe(III) oxide reduction would re-mobilize Fe-bound OC. was removed and replaced by more inert tubing (PEEKTM, 0.65 mm OD x 0.12 mm ID, Sigma-Aldrich). This tubing fed into a fraction collector (CMA 142 Fraction Collector Harvard Apparatus, Hollister, MA) with previously sterilized capped glass vials that allowed for the collection of 300 μL h 1 per rhizobox. Ultrapure water was pumped through 10 mL airtight glass syringes to the microdialysis system by an auto-pump (Standard Infuse/Withdraw PHD, 2000 Syringe Pump, Harvard Apparatus, Hollister, MA). These syringes had three-port microvalves attached that were fastened to the ends of the PEEKTM tubing to the microdialysis system. The microdialysis tubing once affixed to the rhizobox was flushed with ultrapure water for 24 h. Once placed inside the growth chamber, rhizoboxes and microdialysis system were allowed to equilibrate for at least 24 h to adjust from soil rewetting after seedlings were transplanted into the rhizobox system. Once the tap root emerged approximately 1 cm from the top of the microdialysis probe, sampling was initiated to collect background soil pore water. Sampling continued as the root reached the probe, slowly growing along its surface. Samples were collected hourly (300 μL h 1) and subsequently combined to provide composite samples of 4-h resolution. Composites were split, with half flash frozen and the other half refrigerated for immediate DOC analysis. Microdialysis sampling was conducted over three days whereas microelectrode measurements were conducted over five days. DOC concentrations were analyzed using the TOC-L/V- liquid manual smallvolume sample injection unit for the total organic carbon analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-L CPH with an ASI-L, Shimadzu Scientific Inst., Columbia, MD, USA) with a glass airtight syringe following Stubbins and Dittmar (2012). Sample aliquots of 100 μL were manually injected and found to provide the best accuracy and precision with the smallest sample volume. Photosynthesis and transpiration rates were measured on four replicate rhizoboxes treated identically to those described earlier. Measurements were taken on leaves on the second node using a LiCOR 6400XT gas exchange system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) and leaf internal concentration (ci between 221 and 248 μmol CO2 mol 1 in the day) provided by a blue/ red LED light source, temperature-controlled leaf cuvette set to 25 ◦C and light levels at 500 P AR, with an atmospheric CO2 buffer attached (tubing attached to LiCOR 6400XT that fed into 20 L carboy). Measurements were taken over a 24-hr period and recorded every 5 min to record diel plant responses in photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration. In addition, we collected leaf area and leaf count from V. faba at the second node stage. This information was used to parameterize photosynthetic and transpiration rates for the entire plant system in the model.

The East River (ER) is a snow‐dominated, headwater basin of the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) located in the western United States. The ER is the designated testbed of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area (WFSFA). Through WFSFA, observational networks have been established to measure stream discharge and precipitation chemistry. The ER is considered representative of many snow‐dominated headwaters of the Rocky Mountains. The study domain encompasses nearly 85 square km, a 1.4‐km vertical drop in elevation (4,120 to 2,760 m) and pristine alpine, subalpine, montane, and riparian ecosystems. The ER contains high‐energy mountain streams to low‐energy meandering floodplains and is eroding primarily into the Cretaceous, carbon‐rich, marine shale of the Mancos Formation.

(2023) doi:10.15485/1660962	Sediment samples were collected in approximately 15-cm increments using a 5 cm diameter soil core sampler equipped with a slide hammer until coarse alluvium was reached. After reaching coarse alluvium, sediment was sampled using an 8.3 cm diameter bucket auger. Sediment samples were placed in polyethylene bags, sealed into aluminized Mylar bags containing oxygen absorbers, shipped to the laboratory, and stored at 4°C until processing in order to preserve anaerobic conditions observed in some cores. Sediment samples were then sieved through a 2-mm sieve under field-moist conditions in a Coy anaerobic chamber filled with a gas mixture of 97% nitrogen and 3% hydrogen. The <2 mm fraction was then air-dried and ground to fine powder using a Tungsten-carbide ball mill prior to analysis. Bulk X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed using a Rigaku SmartLab high-resolution XRD diffractometer with a Bragg-Brentano geometry. The diffractometer was equipped with a theta-theta goniometer and a rotating sample holder using Cu (λkα1 = 1.5406 Å and λkα2 = 1.5444 Å) cathode. Samples were placed in an aluminum holder to ensure random particle orientations and data were collected from 2 to 80 or 90 °2θ with a 0.02 °2θ step-size and count times of 2 s per step.

Dissolved oxygen and temperature measurements were made in the first few centimeters of wetland sediment to assess how oxygen profiles changed over time with hydrological events. Measurements taken outside of the sediment were taken as comparison. Measurements were taken by hand with a PreSens Fibox 4 transmitter, paired with an oxygen dipping probe and temperature sensor, at each field outing. Measurements were taken approximately every 2 weeks around 10 AM EST. The PreSens_DO_Temp_Datafile.csv contains the recorded measurements, and the PreSens_InstallationMethods.csv describes the deployment of the sensor.	Old Woman Creek (OWC) National Estuarine Research Reserve, Huron, OH (Ameriflux site: Old Woman Creek) is a freshwater marsh located to the south of Lake Erie. A sand beach barrier separates the marsh from the lake, but this barrier periodically erodes which hydrologically links the marsh to the lake until the barrier reforms. To the east of the main channel at OWC is a shallow side channel that flows west into the main channel, referred to as The Cove, where the PreSens meter measurements were collected.	The PreSens Fibox 4 transmitter was used in pair with an oxygen dipping probe (model DP-PSt3) and temperature sensor (model Pt100). To take measurements, the oxygen dipping probe and temperature sensor were held in the user's hand side-by-side and lined up with their tips to be level with each other for consistency. Measurements were taken in five places (if applicable): in the open air out in front of the user (DO_Temp_AIR); approximately 1 centimeter from surface of the water in the overlying water column (DO_Temp_SW); halfway down into the overlying water column (depth varied daily, DO_Temp_MIDWATER); at the sediment-surface water interface, approximately 1 cm deep into the underlying soil of the wetland (DO_Temp_SEDSWINTERFACE); and lastly 6 centimeters deep into the underlying soil (the same length as the end of the oxygen dipping probe, DO_Temp_SED6CM). When The Cove was not inundated, only measurements for the air, the sediment-surface water interface, and 6 centimeters-deep into the soil could be measured as there was no overlying water present. Measurements were taken at each field outing, approximately every two weeks. The PreSens was not deployed long-term as it is a handheld meter.

All stream and spring samples were collected between June and October, 2021, and the shallow, near stream piezometer sample was collected in July of 2022. These data were collected to evaluate how groundwater contributions to Coal Creek originating from shallow vs deep flow paths respond seasonal drying. Understanding of groundwater-surface water interactions in montane systems in critical for the future of water availability in the Western US as groundwater contributions are expected to become more important for sustaining summer stream flows. This data package contains: (1) a csv of all cation samples; (2) a csv of all anion samples; (3) a csv of all 87Sr/87Sr isotope samples; and (4) a csv of locations for each sampling site.

Coal Creek is a small (53 km2), high-elevation, headwater tributary to the Upper Colorado Basin located in the Ruby-Anthracite Range in the central Colorado Rocky Mountains (Figure 1). Coal Creek is located within the larger East River watershed (HUC-10 watershed 750 km2), which hosts the Watershed Function Science Focus Area (SFA) supported by the U.S. Department of Energy and a watershed observatory within the Critical Zone Collaborative Network (CZCN) supported by the National Science Foundation. Coal Creek is geologically bisected; the lower portion of the watershed is underlain predominately by sandstone (Upper Cretaceous Mesaverde Formation) while the upper portion of the watershed is underlain predominately by mafic intrusive plutonic rock.	Samples were collected for chemistry analysis from stream water, two groundwater springs, and one near stream piezometer. Grab samples were taken from the stream and springs in acid washed 120 mL HDPE Nalgene bottles. The near stream piezometer was sampled using a GeoPump Series II Peristaltic Pump. The piezometer was purged and then water was pumped from the piezometer into an acid washed 120 mL HDPE Nalgene bottle. Samples were transferred out of 120 mL bottles into a plastic syringe and filtered through 0.45-micron Nylon filters into respective acid washed bottles for analysis. Anion samples were collected without headspace in 2.0 mL glass vials with Septa caps and were refrigerated until analysis. Cation, trace metal, and strontium (Sr) isotope samples were collected together in 60 mL HDPE Nalgene bottles, acidified with nitric acid to ~pH 2 for preservation, and then later parsed out for analysis. Anion samples were analyzed using ion chromatography (IC) using a Dionex ICS-2100 (Thermo Scientific) to measure concentrations of fluoride, chloride, sulfate, nitrate, and phosphate. Cation samples were analyzed using Agilent 8900 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) triple quadrupole system (Agilent 8900 ICP-QQQ, Agilent Technologies) to measure 36 different elements of interest. Aliquots of the filtered and acidified cation samples were used for Sr isotopic analysis. Sr was separated from matrix elements using Sr resin (Eichrom Technologies Inc.) on miniature Teflon columns. Separated Sr in 2% phosphoric acid was loaded on degassed Re filaments with a Ta emitter solution and run on a Triton (Thermo-Finnigan) multi-collector thermal ionization mass spectrometer using a static procedure. Mass fractionation was corrected to an 86Sr/88Sr of 0.1194, and sample 87Sr/86Sr corrected for 87Rb (negligible in nearly all cases). Three loads of the NIST987 Sr isotopic standard were run per barrel of samples, and sample 87Sr/86Sr ratios were normalized to a NIST987 value of 0.710245.

Dissolved oxygen and temperature measurements were made in the overlying water column of wetland to assess how oxygen changed over time with hydrological events. Measurements were collected by a miniDOT Logger. Data was collected over 1.5 years (June 2022 to December 2023). The miniDOT_DO_Temp_DataFile.csv contains the DO and temperature measurements that were collected every 10 minutes. The water levels of the site varied over-time as the wetland flooded and dried. So, sometimes the miniDOT logger would be out of the water column, resulting in high oxygen levels. Depth of the water column was recorded at every in-person site visit. The miniDOT_Depth_DataFile.csv contains the hand-measured surface water depth measurements for comparison to the logger-collected data. Information on the deployment and measurement methods can be found in the miniDOT_InstallationMethods.csv file.	Old Woman Creek (OWC) National Estuarine Research Reserve, Huron, OH (Ameriflux site: Old Woman Creek) is a freshwater marsh located to the south of Lake Erie. A sand beach barrier separates the marsh from the lake, but this barrier periodically erodes which hydrologically links the marsh to the lake until the barrier reforms. To the east of the main channel at OWC is a shallow side channel that flows west into the main channel, referred to as The Cove, where the miniDOT logger was deployed.	"The miniDOT logger was deployed into The Cove site at Old Woman Creek in-pair with a miniWiper, a device meant to brush clean the miniDOT's sensor spot every 15 minutes from any built up debris. The miniDOT logger and miniWiper were zip-tied to a fence post in the wetland at the end of the boardwalk. The logger was deployed as low into the surface water column as it could be above the underlying sediment. The logger is deployed vertically with the sensor spot on the bottom, hence the importance to keep the logger out of the sediment to measure the water. The surface water of the The Cove was variable due to the nearby barrier beach that frequently opens and closes Old Woman Creek off from Lake Erie, and these changing water depths at some points would leave the miniDOT logger in the open air because the wetland had emptied. The miniDOT would stay deployed in the open air in the event that the wetland would reflood in between site visits. Data would be downloaded from the miniDOT logger during site visits by the Kent State team. The soonest data would be downloaded was 2 weeks from the previous visit, but was not done every time. The miniDOT would be redeployed as close to its original height above the underlying flocky-sediment as it was before. The ""flocky"" layer was the loose, unconsolidated sediment that lay above the hard sediment. Surface water column depth was also recorded for reference, and was measured using a meter stick and visually measuring the end of the meter stick from the top of the water column to both the top of the flocky layer (WaterDepth_flock) and then down into the sediment until resistance was felt (WaterDepth_hard). The flocky depth was difficult to measure some days due to water turbidity, making it difficult to see the meter stick to the top of the flocky sediment. The miniDOT logger was originally removed from December 2022 to May 2023 when it could be redeployed because of the initial concern to leave the logger in frozen water."

The Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments: Arctic (NGEE Arctic), was a research effort to reduce uncertainty in Earth System Models by developing a predictive understanding of carbon-rich Arctic ecosystems and feedbacks to climate. NGEE Arctic was supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska. Through observations, experiments, and synthesis with existing datasets, NGEE Arctic provided an enhanced knowledge base for multi-scale modeling and contributed to improved process representation at global pan-Arctic scales within the Department of Energy's Earth system Model (the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, or E3SM), and specifically within the E3SM Land Model component (ELM)."	Seward Peninsula, Alaska	Temperature data were acquired using distributed temperature profiling probes described in detail in Dafflon et al. (2022). Temperature probes were inserted in the ground, and left to settle for at least 30 min before readings were taken. To reflect deeper ground temperatures, only temperatures at 0.8 m depth were analyzed, and the temperature gradient between 0.6 and 0.8 m was calculated. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data were acquired using 2m electrode spacing and using dipole-dipole measurements with dipole lengths 'a' of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 m, and dipole separations of 1 to 6 'a'. Locations of temperature measurements and electrodes were surveyed using GNSS RTK positioning. ERT data were inverted using an L2 norm on the model space using ResIPy. The mean of the log10 of the resistivity values were extracted at each temperature measurement location at depths between 0 - 1, 1 - 2, 1 - 3, and 5 - 10 m. Temperatures at 0.8 m depth and mean resistivities between 1 - 3 m depth were used for unsupervised classification of near surface permafrost. This data set was then used for supervised classification of the inverted resistivity models to extract permafrost bodies. For each permafrost body, we extracted the mean elevation, slope, aspect, and vegetation height from LiDAR data (Singhania, 2021).

This study used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a processed based model to explore the impacts of area burned and burn severity on streamflow, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in two test basins: a semi-arid, mixed land use basin and a humid, primarily forested basin. We developed 1800 wildfire scenarios that we ran in each basin: 20 different burn extents (5 to 100% by 5%), 3 different burn severities (low, moderate, and high), and 30 different post-fire precipitation scenarios. We also ran an additional 30 scenarios associated with no wildfire for the 30 post-fire precipitation scenarios. For each scenario we were interested in the change in runoff ratio (streamflow) and average concentration and annual loads (nitrate and DOC) across the wildfire scenarios.

Data were collected in Utqiagvik (Barrow), AK and New York in 2018 on 6 species - Arctagrostis latifolia, Helianthus annuus, Populus canadensis, Phaseolus vulgaris, Quercus coccinea, Raphanus sativus. These data were used to compare fitted with estimated values of Vc,max to test the efficacy of the one-point method. Arctic data were used alongside temperate data for an evaluation of one-point gas exchange methodology, supported in part by NGEE Arctic. This dataset is comprised of fitted parameter values and raw gas exchange data files and metadata files in csv format. File formats have been updated from the original publication on the NGEE-Arctic archive, but the data has not been modified. The Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments: Arctic (NGEE Arctic), was a research effort to reduce uncertainty in Earth System Models by developing a predictive understanding of carbon-rich Arctic ecosystems and feedbacks to climate. NGEE Arctic was supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska. Through observations, experiments, and synthesis with existing datasets, NGEE Arctic provided an enhanced knowledge base for multi-scale modeling and contributed to improved process representation at global pan-Arctic scales within the Department of Energy's Earth system Model (the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, or E3SM), and specifically within the E3SM Land Model component (ELM).

The data were collected in order to investigate the role of hyporheic exchange and other river corridor processes on riverine export of solutes. Data includes samples from two intra-meander zones: Meander C, in the Pumphouse vicinity, and Meander Z, just upstream of the confluence with Brush Creek. Floodplain piezometers installed along two transects across Meander C (MCP and MCB wells) and Meander Z (MZA and MZB wells) were sampled on daily to weekly time scales during summer-fall 2019. Some river water grab samples are also included. Data includes in-field measurements (pH, electrical conductivity [EC], oxidation reduction potential [ORP], dissolved oxygen [DO], and groundwater level) along with laboratory measurements (dissolved inorganic carbon [DIC], dissolved organic carbon [DOC], metals and major cations, anions [chloride, sulfate, nitrate], and dissolved ammonium). Files are included in this dataset include: sample locations and depths in both a kmz file which can be opened in Google Earth and a csv file, aqueous geochemistry data in a csv files for Meander C and Meander Z, and analytical detection limits in a csv file. This dataset also includes a file-level metadata (flmd.csv) file that lists each file contained in the dataset with associated metadata and a data dictionary (dd.csv) file that contains column/row headers used throughout the files along with a definition, units, and data type.	The East River (ER) is a snow‐dominated, headwater basin of the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) located in the western United States. The ER is the designated testbed of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area (WFSFA). Through WFSFA, observational networks have been established to measure stream discharge and precipitation chemistry. The ER is considered representative of many snow‐dominated headwaters of the Rocky Mountains. The study domain encompasses nearly 85 square km, a 1.4‐km vertical drop in elevation (4,120 to 2,760 m) and pristine alpine, subalpine, montane, and riparian ecosystems. The ER contains high‐energy mountain streams to low‐energy meandering floodplains and is eroding primarily into the Cretaceous, carbon‐rich, marine shale of the Mancos Formation. Additional metadata on specific locations within the watershed are provided in the following related data package: Varadharajan C. et al. (2023) doi:10.15485/1660962	"Manual water level measurements were performed using an electrical water level meter and are reported in cm bgs (cm below ground surface). Negative values represent conditions where water was above the ground surface (ponded). Groundwater samples were collected using a peristaltic pump from piezometers. A multi-parameter probe was used to measure pH, electrical conductivity (EC, uS/cm) and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP, mV) immediately after sampling in the field. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was measured colorimetrically in the field using a portable spectrophotometer (CHEMetrics, Inc.). Filtered samples (0.45 um PVDF syringe filter) were collected for anions (Cl, SO4, and NO3), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC), ammonium (NH4), and cations (various elements) and shipped to the lab for analysis. Exact volumes and bottle types for each sample are described in the ""East River geochem sampling protocol"" file. DO was measured on unfiltered groundwater using either with the indigo carmine method (Chemetrics #K-7513, 1–15 ppm) or the Rhodazine D™ method (Chemetrics #K-7553, 0–1 ppm). Anion samples were refrigerated at 4 degC for storage and shipment, and analyzed by ion chromatography (IC) using a Dionex ICS-2100 IC (Thermo Scientific). DIC and DOC samples were refrigerated at 4 degC for storage and shipment. Groundwater samples were analyzed for total dissolved carbon and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on a Shimadzu TOC-V analyzer with a nondispersive infrared detector, and dissolved inorganic carbon was determined by the difference. Total dissolved carbon was measured by catalytically aided combustion at 680°C, and DOC samples were analyzed by nonpurgeable organic carbon, for which samples were acidified with HCl and purged with N2 in order to remove inorganic carbon prior to the analysis. Ammonium (NH4) samples were acidified to pH 2 using 2 M HCl and refrigerated at 4 degC for storage and shipment. Samples were analyzed by flow injection analysis using the colorimetric salicylate method (Lachat Instruments). Elemental concentrations were measured in ""cation"" samples by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Perkin-Elmer Elan DRC II) after acidification and dilution with ultrapure 0.16 M nitric acid and internal standard addition. Detection limits for each parameter are listed in the detection limits file and were either reported by instrument manufacturer (DO) or calculated as 5 times the standard deviation of a MilliQ water blank (all others). Any data below the detection limit is reported as ""BDL"". Missing data is listed as ""-9999"" and data below detection limits is listed as ""BDL""."

This study used reach-scale modeled estimates of hyporheic aerobic respiration made by the River Corridor Model (Fang et al. 2020) and watershed characteristics across the Willamette and Yakima River basins to explore potential allometric scaling (i.e., power-law relationships between size and function) of cumulative hyporheic respiration across catchment-to-basin scales. Scaling was explored quantitatively via the R2, slope, and y-intercept of relationships between cumulative hyporheic respiration and watershed area, divided into hyporheic exchange flux (HEF) quantiles. We also explored relationships between allometric scaling and other watershed characteristics through linear regression, spatial patterns, and mutual information analyses. Our results also suggest variability of hyporheic respiration allometry for middle exchange flux quantiles, and in relation to land-cover. Our findings provide initial evidence that allometric scaling may be useful for predicting hyporheic biogeochemical dynamics across watersheds from reach to basin scales. This data package is associated with the GitHub repository found at https://github.com/peterregier/rc_wrb_yrb_scaling. The data package is organized into several key directories. The “data” folder contains multiple CSV files, including landscape heterogeneity, scaling analysis, and watershed boundary data. The “figures” folder has all figure files in both PDF and PNG formats. Core analysis scripts and figure generation scripts are in the “scripts” directory, systematically numbered for sequential execution. The root directory includes essential project files; please see the file ending in “flmd.csv” for a list and description of all files contained in this data package and the file ending in “dd.csv” for data dictionaries used to describe tabular column headers.	Willamette and Yakima River basins in the Pacific Northwest United States	"This data package includes reach-scale modeled outputs for hyporheic respiration and additional watershed hydrobiogeochemical parameters from the River Corridor Model, detailed in Fang et al. (2020) and presented in Son et al. (2022). Our analysis calculated cumulative values for hyporheic respiration and other properties, including watershed area, for every reach within the Yakima and Willamette River basins with outputs written as CSVs to the “data” folder. R scripts in the “scripts"" folder were used to prepare model outputs, calculate allometric scaling relationships, interpret these relationships in the context of watershed characteristics, and create the figures in the manuscript. The model was trained using USGS sites from across the Columbia River Basin, including 38 sites for dissolved oxygen (using 4470 measurements), 50 sites for dissolved organic carbon (4842 measurements), and 64 sites for nitrate (3070 measurements). Dissolved organic carbon is the only carbon source for HZ respiration represented in the model. We gap-filled missing vertical/lateral water exchange flux and residence time values for ~13% of reaches using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, v1.5.0.2) machine learning model. We calculated allometric scaling relationships as cumulative hyporheic aerobic respiration (g CO2 d-1) against watershed area (km2). We categorized the scaling behavior of relationships between cumulative hyporheic respiration and watershed area for each combination of HEF bin and basin (n = 20) into four allometry classes: Uncertain, Sublinear, Linear, and Super-linear. We defined the allometry categories based on visual identification of an R2 threshold of 0.8 where values exhibit a “knee”. To reveal watershed features explaining variation in the spatial distributions of hyporheic respiration across each basin, we used mutual information analysis, which calculates the dependency between two variables based on Shannon's entropy.

The study addressed common challenges faced in environmental sensing and modeling, including uncertain input data, missing sensor observations, and high-dimensional datasets with interrelated but redundant variables. Point-scaled meteorological and soil sensor observations were perturbed with noises and missing values, and denoising autoencoder (DAE) neural networks were developed to reconstruct the perturbed data and further predict evapotranspiration. This study concluded that (1) the reconstruction quality of each variable depends on its cross-correlation and alignment to the underlying data structure, (2) uncertainties from the models were overall stronger than those from the data corruption, and (3) there was a tradeoff between reducing bias and reducing variance when evaluating the uncertainty of the machine learning models.

The time is given as time of measurement in Mountain Time (MT). Gaps in the data are present (shown by period of time with no time reported) and linked to sensor failure or data not saved due to full memory. There are also a few spikes (mainly due to human activity) that has been cleaned. These times have been removed from the files. And, suspicious temperature and pressure data have been replaced with -9999 values. Also, please note that the water table depth values that are close to the length of the sensor string imply that the sensor was close or above the groundwater table. Overall, the time-interval is not constant and several gaps are present in the data. Also be aware that due to the fact that the software used to download and program the sensor aw not tracking UTC time but the time set on the connected computer, it is possible that the operator did sometime set the time inadvertently off of one hour (i.e., consider the time uncertainty being one hour). The main uncertainty in the datasets is due to well casing slightly moving over time. This is a potential issue once looking at gradient between short distances or over time. Every difference less than 5 cm in water level elevation between two wells should be interpreted carefully (and depends on the wells considered). Also because of slight changes over time, including changing string length in some cases, the final dataset is slightly different (up to a few cm) from the 2019 dataset archived previously. General trend: In short, the wells located next to the river (<10 m) are highly influenced by the river stage. The other wells show quite distinct behavior. Most of the wells have water level elevations reaching the surface or slightly above it when snowmelt occurs upstream in the watershed around the June period (confirmed with ground elevation data and aerial images). All wells in the floodplain show an increase in water level during winter, especially during early snowmelt. Once the river opens (around April), water levels in wells drop quickly (especially at locations close to the river) before increasing again during upstream snowmelt. It is important to keep in mind that measurements during the period when the river is closed (fully frozen or with a partial ice layer) must be interpreted carefully, because hydrological conditions may be strongly different than when the river is open. During river closure, some wells may remain open (without an ice layer or plug building above the sensor), while at other locations and times, the aquifer system may be confined.

Finally, -9999 values for water level and temperature are present in the file when water level is deeper than the sensor (Flag==1). Overall, the time-interval is not constant and several gaps are present in the data. Also be aware that due to the fact that the software used to download and program the sensor aw not tracking UTC time but the time set on the connected computer, it is possible that the operator did sometime set the time inadvertently off of one hour (i.e., consider the time uncertainty being one hour). The main uncertainty in the datasets is due to well casing slightly moving over time. This is a potential issue once looking at gradient between short distances or over time. Every difference less than 5 cm in water level elevation between two wells should be interpreted carefully (and depends on the wells considered). Also because of slight changes over time, including changing string length in some cases, the final dataset is slightly different (up to a few cm) from the 2019 dataset archived previously. General trend: In short, the wells located next to the river (<10 m) are highly influenced by the river stage. The other wells show quite distinct behavior. Most of the wells have water level elevations reaching the surface or slightly above it when snowmelt occurs upstream in the watershed around the June period (confirmed with ground elevation data and aerial images). All wells in the floodplain show an increase in water level during winter, especially during early snowmelt. Once the river opens (around April), water levels in wells drop quickly (especially at locations close to the river) before increasing again during upstream snowmelt. It is important to keep in mind that measurements during the period when the river is closed (fully frozen or with a partial ice layer) must be interpreted carefully, because hydrological conditions may be strongly different than when the river is open. During river closure, some wells may remain open (without an ice layer or plug building above the sensor), while at other locations and times, the aquifer system may be confined.

Collected living and dead douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) material on 16 May 2021 at 09:20 PST.	This study uses a subset of samples from Grieger et al. (2022); refer to Grieger et al. (2022) for details on the experimental design and the meaning behind the sample names Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) vegetation was collected from the field and burned on open air tables under varying burning conditions to generate chars. Char burn severity was classified according to US Forest Service field metrics. Total elemental analysis (P, sulfur, aluminum, iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and potassium) of the solid chars was measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Solution-state 31P NMR experiments were conducted on char extracts and P-XANES was collected on intact solid samples. Unburned vegetation and chars were leached with synthetic rainwater to simulate what might be mobilized from the solid material during rain events. Leachates were filtered through a coarse mesh followed by a nominal 0.7 micrometers (µm) pore size. Coarse filtered and < 0.7 µm filtered leachates were ran for total elemental analyses using ICP-OES. Total elemental concentration of the leachate particulate phase (2 mm to 0.7 μm) was calculated as the difference between the coarse filtered and aqueous phase. Molybdate reactive P in the leachate aqueous phase was also measured. See the methods section of the manuscript for more details.

Observations were made from 2004-2010 (2004-01-01 to 2010-12-31). These data were generated to assess seasonal and interannual variability in metabolism and organic carbon spiraling and to explore potential driver variables, as analyses of intra- and interannual variability in metabolism and organic carbon spiraling are currently limited, leaving knowledge gaps in the driving mechanisms of and future changes to stream metabolism and carbon processing under climate change. Additionally, measurements of discharge (Q), stream width, stream- and canopy-level photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), water temperature, and precipitation from this time frame are included. This dataset contains one data file in comma separated (*.csv) format.	West fork of Walker Branch (Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA)	Walker Branch Watershed (WBW) is a 97.5 ha second-growth forest on the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge Reservation in east Tennessee, USA. There are two headwaters streams that drain the watershed: the West Fork drains 38.4 ha and the East Fork drains 59.1 ha (Curlin and Nelson 1968). The watershed is underlain by bedrock (Knox Dolomite) with deep soils, primarily Utisols. Vegetation is primarily oaks (Quercus prinus, Quercus alba), tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), red maple (Acer rubrum), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia) (Johnson 1989, Kardol et al. 2010). The climate is typical of the southern Appalachian region, with a mean annual temperature of 14.5ºC and mean annual precipitation of 135 cm (Curlin and Nelson 1968, Johnson 1989). The West Fork is approximately 300 m in length from the headwaters to the location where the East and West Forks meet. Four perennial springs discharge to the West Fork. Daily gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) were calculated from dissolved oxygen and temperature measurements (collected at 15-min intervals) collected using YSI Model 6562, 6150, and 6920 sondes, corrected for air-water O2 exchange via the reaeration coefficient, and following open-system, single-station method, as in Young and Huryn (1999), Houser et al. (2005), and Roberts et al. (2007). Heterotrophic respiration (ERhet), used in the organic carbon spiraling metric calculations, was calculated from ER and GPP using an autotrophic respiration fraction of 0.43 calculated previously for Walker Branch (Hall and Beaulieu 2013), a respiration quotient of 1 following Roberts et al. (2007), and an O2 to carbon conversion factor of 0.375355, as in Hall and Beaulieu (2013). Stream width (w) was calculated from discharge (Q), as in Roberts et al. (2007). Organic carbon (OC) spiraling metrics were calculated following Newbold et al. (1982) and Hall et al. (2016). We focused on the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) component due to data availability, which was measured weekly and interpolated using a composite loading model. Organic carbon spiraling length (SOC) is the average distance an OC molecule travels before mineralization, calculated as: SOC = (Q × [DOC]) / (ERhet × w). Organic carbon mineralization velocity (VfOC) represents the speed at which an OC molecule moves towards conversion to CO2 via mineralization, calculated as: VfOC = ERhet / [DOC]. Additional details on data collection and processing can be found in Mulholland and Griffiths (2016) and Griffiths and Mulholland (2021) for water chemistry, and in Roberts et al. (2007) and Roberts and Mulholland (2007) for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), discharge, water temperature, and metabolism.

Interdisciplinary work within a large team requires agreement regarding levels of functional organization so that knowledge, data, and technologies can be shared and combined effectively. The team has identified plant functional types as a crucial area where such interoperability is needed. PFTs are used to represent plant pools and fluxes within models, summarize observational data, and map vegetation across the landscape. Within each of these applications, varying levels of PFT specificity are needed according to the specific scientific research goal, computational limitations, and data availability. By agreeing on a specific hierarchical framework for grouping variables in our vegetation data, we ensure the resulting research products will be robust, flexible, and scalable. In this document, we lay out the agreed upon PFT framework with definitions and references to existing literature. Table 1 included in the ""NGA700_Phase4PFTFramework_about*"" file outlines the relationship between NGEE-Arctic Phase 4, Tier 1 PFTs and the PFTs used within prominent arctic literature as well as publications by the NGEE-Arctic team during phases 1-3. This dataset consists of a table detailing a hierarchical PFT framework that spans 4 tiers with the most granular PFTs listed in tier 1 and the most general PFTs in tier 4. The PFTs within each tier has a single column in the dataset where the PFTs are named and a separate column where the characteristics used to define that PFT are listed. Grey fill of the cells is used to indicate where a given PFT starts to “lose” tier 1 details as you look from left to right. Note the excel file has merged cells to indicate grouping of PFTs across the Tiers- it will not translate into a delimited filetype (.csv, .txt, etc) without modification thus the hierarchical PFT framework table is available in three different file formats: 1) NGA700_Phase4PTS.xlsx – maintains the merged cells and grey fill; 2) NGA700_Phase4PTS.csv – merged cells are split, and grey fill is removed; 3) NGA700_Phase4PTS.pdf – image of the table with merged cells and grey fill. Metadata document included as a *.pdf and file-level metadata and data dictionary as *.csv files."	Pan-arctic region	"The framework presented here was developed within the NGEE-Arctic project following discussion about interdisciplinary research goals, limitations, and reflection upon historic representation of PFTs within the arctic literature. This process of discussing arctic PFTs began during NGEE-Arctic Phase 3 when field and literature data was being synthesized for the Sulman et al. 2021 publication. At that point, the team identified several key PFT groupings in the existing arctic literature that should be brought to ELM. These included 1) separating shrub species by their maximum potential height (as in Walker et al. 2000) and 2) inclusion of moss and lichen, which are largely absent from earth system models (Wullschleger et al. 2014). Table 1 included in the ""NGA700_Phase4PFTFramework_about*"" file outlines the relationship between NGEE-Arctic Phase 4, Tier 1 PFTs and the PFTs used within prominent arctic literature as well as publications by the NGEE-Arctic team during phases 1-3. During phase 4, the team’s research goals include both small scale model simulations at evaluation sites to investigate specific model evaluation questions as well as pan-arctic simulations. The varying spatial scales, model resolution, and interdisciplinary nature of Phase 4 data highlighted the need for a hierarchical PFT framework so that synthesized data products could be useful for an array of applications across the Phase 4 team. The choice to use a given tier of PFTs within this framework will depend on the specific research activity. For instance, when mapping PFTs across the landscape, the decision will likely be influenced by the ability to differentiate PFTs within remote sensing products available across the entire region of interest. When running ESM simulations, the choice of PFTs will be constrained by representation of PFTs within a given model as well as required input data for those PFTs. When synthesizing empirical data for model parameterization and/or benchmarking, the PFTs across which summary analyses are performed will likely rely on availability of data within existing arctic literature. Formal archival of this PFT framework was deemed appropriate for formal documentation of the team’s decision process."

Old Woman Creek (OWC) National Estuarine Research Reserve, Huron, OH (Ameriflux site: Old Woman Creek) is a freshwater marsh located to the south of Lake Erie. A sand beach barrier separates the marsh from the lake, but this barrier periodically erodes which hydrologically links the marsh to the lake until the barrier reforms. To the east of the main channel at OWC is a shallow side channel that flows west into the main channel, referred to as The Cove, where the soil cores were collected.	Soil cores were collected on one day, October 24, 2024. Three soil cores were collected, and they were collected in the same general area as the sub-sites of the redox probes and sipper samplers (within approximately 7 feet of each other). Sub-sites 1, 2, and 3 of the soil core chemistry dataset correspond with the same sub-sites within the redox probe and porewater-surface water chemistry datasets of the same project. Soil cores were collected with an acrylic tube, 3-inches diameter, collecting cores approximately 10-inches tall. The day of collection, the wetland was dry of standing surface water, though the soil itself was still wet and mucky with few standing water puddles on its surface. At sub-sites 1, 2, and 3, cores were collected by-hand by pushing the tubes into the soil. The top of the tubing was capped, and then to cap the bottom of the core, the collecting person shoved their hands down into the soil, outside of the sampling tube, and secured the cap onto the tube. The bottom cap was put on while still in the ground to minimize atmospheric exposure. Cores were measured for oxygen profiles (not included in dataset), and then removed from their tubes and divided into 4 segments: A, B, C, and D. A being the top-most layer and D the bottom-most layer of the core. Please refer to SoilChem_SampleMetdata.csv for size and lengths of the segments. The core segments were then cut in half for replicates (cores cut vertically down the middle to keep depths intact), individually bagged and homogenized, and stored in a cooler. Upon returning to the lab, the soil core samples were stored in the freezer until analysis. Various analyses were done on the soil samples. These analyses include wet-weight to dry-weight ratio; carbon loss on ignition (LOI); ascorbate, dithionite, and hot-acid extractions measuring for various elements on a Perkin Elmer Optima 8000 ICP-OES; and iron (II) measured on a Thermo Scientific Genesys 10S UV-Vis.

Surface and pore water samples were taken to analyze what nutrient and/or metal constituents were present at different depths in the wetland at different times and to compare to redox potential values. Porewater was collected by constructed sippers and deployed into the underlying soil of the wetland, and they were samples approximately every 2 weeks (when groundwater was present) in 2023. Surface water was collected approximately 1 inch below the surface of the water column (if available) via a syringe. Unfiltered and 0.45 micron filtered samples were collected. Samples were analyzed for various chemistry and is reported in the SWChem (surface water chemistry) and PWChem (porewater chemistry) .csv datafiles. Collection information about the samples can be found within the PWChem_SWChem_SampleMetdata.csv file. All files associated with this dataset are listed in the PWChem_SWChem_FLMD.csv file.	Old Woman Creek (OWC) National Estuarine Research Reserve, Huron, OH (Ameriflux site: Old Woman Creek) is a freshwater marsh located to the south of Lake Erie. A sand beach barrier separates the marsh from the lake, but this barrier periodically erodes which hydrologically links the marsh to the lake until the barrier reforms. To the east of the main channel at OWC is a shallow side channel that flows west into the main channel, referred to as The Cove, where the porewater and surface water samples were collected.	Surface water samples were collected by hand at every field outing when the wetland was not dry. Using a 60 milliliter luer-lock syringe, surface water was collected approximately 1 inch below the surface of the water column. A sample-rinse was done with the syringe by emptying and discarding the initial collected water in the syringe and recollecting for the samples. One unfiltered and one filtered water sample were collected into 50 milliliter centrifuge tubes. Filtered samples were filtered by a 0.45 micron PES filter attached to the syringe. Samples were stored in an iced cooler and frozen upon returning to the lab. Porewater was sampled via sipper samplers that were deployed long-term in the wetland soil. Sippers were modeled after designs by the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center; a long, straw-like tube, one end at a known depth down into the soil with holes and the other end connected to Tygon tubing with a luer lock. The holes were covered in a fine, nylon mesh-material to prevent large debris from clogging the sipper and preventing water collection. The luer lock allowed the samplers to be connected a syringe for collection, as well as to seal off the samplers' tubing from oxygen that make oxygenate the sample. Four sippers were deployed near each of the redox probes within The Cove, twelve sippers in total. The 4 sippers at each sub-site were of different lengths, or depths: at the sediment-surface water interface, 6 inches, 8 inches, and 12 inches. At each field outing (approximately every 2 weeks), the sippers would be sampled. If no overlying surface water was available, there still may have been porewater available to be sampled. The sampling syringe would be connected to the luer lock of the sippers. Porewater would be plugged into the syringe by suction; short half-inch PVC pipes and rubber bands were used to keep the syringe plugger pulled out to save our hands from fighting the suction. Once the syringe would stop filling, the luer lock would be closed and the syringe removed, and the water would be aliquoted for whichever either all intended analyses or only some, depending upon the volume collected and the volumes needed for each analysis. If enough volume was available, pH was measured in the field using an EcoSense YSI pH meter. Water samples were stored upon returning to the lab depending upon the need of each analysis. Please refer to the methods file included in this dataset (PWChem_SWChem_Methods.csv) for more information on sampling, storage, preparation, and analyses methods. Analyses for porewater and surface water samples included nutrient analysis on a Skalar SAN++ continuous flow analyzer (NO3-N, NH4-N, and orthophosphate), Dionex Integrion HPIC ion chromatography (fluoride, chloride, bromide, and sulfate), Fe (II) with a Thermo Scientific Genesys 10S UV-Vis. Only porewater was also measured for total hydrogen sulfide with a Thermo Scientific Genesys 10S UV-Vis, and total elemental concentrations with a Optima 8000 ICP-OES.

Here, a discontinuous permafrost underlies an arctic tundra ecosystem. Measurements include elemental carbon and nitrogen concentrations and stocks, organic layer thickness, and thaw depth. There are five files in *.csv format with one data file and four data description files including data dictionary, methods, terminology, and file-level metadata. The Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments: Arctic (NGEE Arctic), was a research effort to reduce uncertainty in Earth System Models by developing a predictive understanding of carbon-rich Arctic ecosystems and feedbacks to climate. NGEE Arctic was supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska. Through observations, experiments, and synthesis with existing datasets, NGEE Arctic provided an enhanced knowledge base for multi-scale modeling and contributed to improved process representation at global pan-Arctic scales within the Department of Energy's Earth system Model (the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, or E3SM), and specifically within the E3SM Land Model component (ELM).	Unburned. Kougarok Fire Complex is a tussock tundra ecosystem with overlapping burn scars that now varies in fire severity, time after fire, and number of times burned.	Collected the organic layer using a 12cm x 12cm plot guide to mark out the sampling point. Next, a serrated, bread knife, was used for cutting along the interior sides of the guide. The square brownie was carefully lifted out of the hole. The depth of the hole was measured at all four corners and served as measure of the organic layer depth. The organic layer collected from the hole was transported back to ORNL and air-dried. The air-dried organic layer was ground (GenoGrinder) A sub-sample of the organic layer was analyzed for elemental carbon and nitrogen using a dry combustion method (UNICUBE, Elementar). The total mass of the air-dried organic layer was recorded.
